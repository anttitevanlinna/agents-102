# Direct Competitors — Findings & Orientation Log

**Track**: Direct Competitors — Agentic Training Programs

---

## Round 1 — 2026-02-14

### Observe

Searched: "AI agent training programs for businesses" and "agentic AI bootcamp enterprise". Found 5 programs worth documenting. The market has exploded since mid-2025 — there are dozens of programs using "agentic AI" in their names. Most are developer courses on Udemy/Coursera. A smaller set targets business audiences.

Programs cataloged:
1. DASA — Agentic AI Enterprise Strategist Bootcamp
2. Design Sprint Academy — Agentic AI Bootcamp
3. AI Academy — AI Agent Bootcamp
4. Data Science Dojo — Agentic AI Bootcamp
5. UT Austin McCombs — AI Agents PG Program for Business Applications

### Orient

**Patterns forming:**

1. **The market splits cleanly into two camps.** Camp A is developer bootcamps (Udemy, Coursera, Zero to Mastery) that teach frameworks like LangGraph, CrewAI, and AutoGen. Camp B is strategy-oriented programs (DASA, Design Sprint Academy) that talk about organizational change. Almost nothing sits in the middle — where Agents 102 wants to be.

2. **"Hands-on" means different things to different programs.** For developer bootcamps, it means writing code. For strategy programs, it means filling in frameworks and canvases. Very few programs have non-coders actually building working agents. This is likely the hardest instructional design problem in this space.

3. **Organizational transformation is rare.** Most programs are individual upskilling. DASA is the only one that explicitly frames itself around reshaping how organizations work. Even Design Sprint Academy, despite the enterprise language, is really about producing a prototype in a week, not changing an organization.

4. **No one owns "non-coders building agents."** This phrase appears in marketing copy, but when you look at the actual curricula, the programs either (a) teach coding under a friendlier label, or (b) stay at the strategy level and never actually have participants build. The gap is real and unoccupied.

5. **Duration varies wildly.** From 16 hours (DASA) to 9 weeks (Data Science Dojo). No consensus on how long it takes to develop this capability.

**What surprised us:**

- How few programs genuinely combine the non-coder audience with real agent building. The market talks about it, but almost nobody delivers it.
- DASA's "Agentic Enterprise" framing is the closest to Agents 102's organizational transformation vision, but it stays entirely strategic — no building.
- Design Sprint Academy coming from the design sprint world, not the AI world. They bring methodology expertise (how to run intensive workshops) rather than AI depth. Interesting positioning.
- The Johns Hopkins certificate program exists but appears to be a traditional academic offering — more AI/ML engineering than business transformation.

**Current hypothesis about this market:**

The agentic AI training market is forming around a classic expertise-accessibility trade-off. Programs are either deep and technical (for developers) or broad and strategic (for executives). No one has cracked the middle: teaching non-coders to actually build agents while framing this as organizational transformation. This is precisely where Agents 102 sits, and it appears to be a genuine gap, not just a positioning claim.

The risk: this gap may exist because it is hard to deliver, not because no one has thought of it. The instructional design challenge of making agent-building accessible without coding is the core difficulty.

**What's still unclear or missing:**

- How do the developer-focused bootcamps (Udemy, Coursera specializations) position themselves? Are any of them stretching toward non-coders? Round 2 could check.
- What about consulting firms (McKinsey, Accenture, Deloitte) — do they run internal agentic AI training for client organizations? This would be a hidden competitor set.
- Pricing data is weak. We need to understand what the market charges.
- What about AI platform vendors (Microsoft, Google, Salesforce) running their own agent training? They have massive reach and may be competing indirectly.

### Decide

**Next round angle**: Vendor-led training programs — Microsoft Copilot Studio training, Salesforce Agentforce training, Google Vertex AI agent training, and similar platform-specific programs.

**Why**: These are potentially the largest-scale competitor to Agents 102, even though they are vendor-locked. When an organization decides to "train people on AI agents," the easiest path is to pick their existing vendor's training program. If Microsoft, Salesforce, and Google are running agent-building courses for non-technical users through their platforms, that is the real competitive pressure Agents 102 faces — not indie bootcamps. This angle will test whether vendor lock-in is the dominant market force, and whether Agents 102's vendor-agnostic positioning is a strength or a liability.

## Round 2 — 2026-02-14

### Observe

Searched: "Microsoft Copilot Studio training program agent building" and "Salesforce Agentforce training Google Vertex AI agent builder training program." Found 5 vendor-led programs across three major vendors (Microsoft, Salesforce, Google).

Programs cataloged:
6. Microsoft Copilot Studio Agent Academy
7. Microsoft Learn — Create Agents with Microsoft Copilot Studio (Learning Path)
8. Salesforce Trailhead — Agentblazer Champion 2026
9. Salesforce Agentforce Specialist Certification
10. Google Cloud Skills Boost — Vertex AI Agent Builder Training

### Orient

**How vendor programs change the picture from Round 1:**

Round 1 revealed a gap between developer bootcamps and strategy programs. Round 2 reveals a third category that dwarfs both: **vendor product training**. Microsoft, Salesforce, and Google are not competing in the "agentic AI training" market — they are creating their own parallel market where "learning about agents" means "learning our agent product."

This is the most important finding so far. The competitive landscape is not a spectrum from technical to strategic. It is a triangle:

1. **Developer bootcamps** (code-heavy, framework-specific, small enrollment)
2. **Strategy programs** (framework-heavy, leadership-focused, small enrollment)
3. **Vendor product training** (free, massive scale, zero transferable understanding)

Vendor programs dominate on volume. Microsoft Learn and Salesforce Trailhead each reach millions of users. Every indie bootcamp and university program combined does not match their scale. When a CTO says "we need to train our team on AI agents," the path of least resistance is Copilot Studio training (if they are a Microsoft shop) or Agentforce Trailhead (if they are a Salesforce shop).

**Is vendor lock-in the dominant force?**

Yes, but not in the way we expected. Vendor lock-in is not just a competitive threat — it is the default experience most organizations will have with "agent training." The danger for Agents 102 is not that vendor programs are better; it is that vendor programs are free, frictionless, and already embedded in the tools people use. They will absorb most of the market demand before independent programs even get a chance to pitch.

However, vendor programs have a structural ceiling. They teach *how to use a product*, not *how to think about agents*. A person who completes Copilot Studio Agent Academy can build a Copilot agent. They cannot:
- Evaluate whether a Copilot agent is the right solution
- Design an agent architecture across multiple platforms
- Understand why an agent fails or behaves unexpectedly
- Lead an organizational shift toward agentic workflows
- Compare vendor offerings critically

This ceiling is permanent. Vendors will never teach platform-agnostic thinking because it undermines their business model.

**Is vendor-agnostic a strength or liability?**

Both, depending on who you are selling to.

**Liability** when selling to: individual practitioners who just want to "build an agent" right now. They will take the free vendor training. Agents 102 cannot and should not compete here.

**Strength** when selling to: organizations making strategic decisions about AI adoption. These buyers need to:
- Evaluate multiple vendor options
- Build capability that survives vendor switches
- Develop internal judgment about agent design, not just product operation
- Transform workflows, not just add tools

For this audience, vendor lock-in is the problem, and vendor-agnostic training is the solution. Agents 102 is the prerequisite — the competence layer that makes vendor training effective and vendor choices informed. Without agent thinking, vendor training teaches button-pressing. With it, vendor training becomes strategic.

**Updated hypothesis about the competitive landscape:**

The market has three tiers, not two:

- **Tier 1 (mass market):** Vendor product training. Free, massive, zero transferable understanding. This is where 90% of "agent training" volume goes. Microsoft, Salesforce, Google.
- **Tier 2 (professional development):** Independent bootcamps and university programs. Paid, moderate scale, mix of practical skills and frameworks. AI Academy, Data Science Dojo, UT Austin.
- **Tier 3 (organizational transformation):** Strategic programs that frame agents as an organizational change, not an individual skill. Tiny volume, high impact per participant. DASA.

Agents 102 sits between Tier 2 and Tier 3 — combining practical agent-building with organizational transformation framing — while being accessible to non-coders. This is still an unoccupied position. The vendor programs, despite their scale, actually reinforce this gap rather than filling it. They create millions of people who know how to operate agent products but lack the understanding to deploy them wisely. Agents 102 is the program that creates that understanding.

**What surprised us:**

- How openly accessible vendor programs are. Microsoft and Salesforce agent training is free and genuinely well-designed. Trailhead in particular is an exceptional learning platform. The quality bar for learning design is set high by these programs — Agents 102 needs to match it.
- Google is significantly more technical than Microsoft or Salesforce in its agent training. Google's Vertex AI training covers real architectural concepts (multi-agent orchestration, MCP and A2A protocols) but requires developer skills. There is no "citizen developer" path for Google's agent platform.
- Microsoft's "conversation as the agent-making interface" — where you build agents by talking to them in natural language — is a remarkable accessibility move. If this works well, it redefines what "non-coder builds an agent" means. Agents 102 needs to acknowledge this reality.
- None of the vendor programs even gesture toward organizational transformation. This is not a gap they will fill. It is structurally outside their interests.

**What's still unclear or missing:**

- How do consulting firms (McKinsey, Accenture, Deloitte) position their agentic AI training for clients? They may be the hidden heavyweight — combining vendor-specific skills with strategic framing and charging premium prices. This is the closest potential competitor to Agents 102's positioning.
- What about no-code AI agent platforms (Zapier, Make, n8n with AI) that provide their own training? These might be the "vendor-agnostic vendor" — platform training that is not tied to Microsoft/Salesforce/Google but still product-specific.
- How do organizations actually buy training today? Do they go to vendors first, or do they search for independent programs? The buyer journey matters more than the program quality.

### Decide

**Next round angle**: Consulting firm and no-code platform training — McKinsey/Accenture/Deloitte agentic AI offerings and no-code agent platforms (Zapier AI agents, Make, n8n) with their associated training programs.

**Why**: Consulting firms are the one competitor type that could plausibly occupy the same position as Agents 102 — vendor-agnostic, strategically framed, targeted at organizational leaders, and practically oriented. If Deloitte runs a "Build Your Agentic Enterprise" workshop, that is a direct competitor in a way that Trailhead is not. No-code platforms, meanwhile, may have cracked the "non-coders building agents" problem through their own tooling, with training built around their platform. Round 3 will test whether the gap identified in Rounds 1 and 2 is truly empty or merely hidden behind consulting paywalls and platform ecosystems.

## Round 3 — Consulting Firms & No-Code Platforms | 2026-02-14

### Observe

Searched: "McKinsey Accenture Deloitte BCG agentic AI training workshop program enterprise 2025 2026" and "Zapier AI agents training Make n8n no-code agent building course education program 2025 2026." Found 5 entries worth documenting across consulting firms and no-code platforms.

Programs cataloged:
11. McKinsey — "Unlocking AI and Agentic for Your Organization"
12. Deloitte / Accenture / BCG — AI Agent Advisory & Enablement (grouped)
13. Udemy — No-Code AI Agent Courses (n8n, Zapier, Multi-Platform)
14. Zapier Agents — Platform Documentation & Guides
15. Make & n8n — Platform Education

### Orient

**The core finding: neither consulting firms nor no-code platforms fill the gap. They define its edges.**

**Consulting firms do not offer training programs.** This was the most important thing to verify, and the answer is clear. McKinsey, Deloitte, Accenture, and BCG all have agentic AI practices, thought leadership, and client engagements — but none of them offers an enrollable, standalone training program on building or deploying AI agents. Their model is consulting: they do the transformation *for* the client, with embedded capability-building as a deliverable within multi-million-dollar engagements. McKinsey's "Agentic Organization" concept is intellectually sophisticated and strategically aligned with what Agents 102 teaches, but it is delivered as advisory services to Fortune 500 companies, not as a training program accessible to the broader market.

This means consulting firms are not competitors to Agents 102. They are **context** — they validate the importance of the topic and shape the strategic language, but they do not compete for the same buyer. An organization that hires McKinsey to redesign around agentic AI is not the same buyer who enrolls a team in Agents 102. However, McKinsey's published frameworks (and BCG's similar work with MIT Sloan) create awareness and urgency that Agents 102 can ride: "You've read the McKinsey report. Now build the capability internally."

**No-code platforms have cracked half the problem.** n8n, Zapier, and Make genuinely enable non-coders to build working agent-like automations. The Udemy ecosystem around these platforms is thriving — multiple courses with tens of thousands of students, explicitly targeting non-technical users, with participants building real agents. This is the closest thing to what Agents 102 promises on the "hands-on building" dimension.

But these programs lack everything else. They are tool tutorials, not transformation programs. They teach how to wire nodes in n8n or configure Zapier Agents, not how to think about agents, evaluate agent architectures, handle failure modes, or lead organizational change. They attract freelancers and individual productivity enthusiasts, not teams and leaders. And they are platform-specific — a participant learns n8n, not the principles that make any agent platform effective.

**The triangle model from Round 2 is now a quadrilateral.** Round 2 identified three categories: developer bootcamps, strategy programs, and vendor product training. Round 3 adds a fourth:

1. **Developer bootcamps** — code-heavy, framework-specific, small enrollment
2. **Strategy programs** — framework-heavy, leadership-focused, small enrollment
3. **Vendor product training** — free, massive scale, platform-locked
4. **No-code platform tutorials** — accessible, hands-on, zero strategic framing (NEW)

Consulting firms are not a fifth category — they are outside the training market entirely. They operate in the advisory market and do not compete for training buyers.

**Where Agents 102 sits — confirmed and sharpened:**

The gap is real and now precisely defined. Agents 102 occupies the intersection of:
- **Hands-on building** (like no-code tutorials) — but with transferable principles, not platform-locked skills
- **Strategic transformation framing** (like consulting firms) — but accessible, enrollable, and affordable
- **Non-coder accessibility** (like vendor training) — but vendor-agnostic and principle-first
- **Organizational scope** (like DASA) — but with participants actually building working agents

No existing program combines all four. The closest competitors each deliver one or two dimensions well but miss the others entirely. The gap is not a marketing claim — it is a structural feature of how this market has fragmented.

**Why the gap persists — it is an instructional design problem, not a market oversight:**

The gap exists because it is genuinely hard to deliver. Teaching non-coders to build agents requires choosing a platform (which creates lock-in) or teaching principles abstractly (which loses the hands-on dimension). Framing it as organizational transformation requires enterprise credibility that indie training providers struggle to establish. Keeping it vendor-agnostic means you cannot rely on any single vendor's training infrastructure.

Agents 102 needs to solve this instructional design tension explicitly. The most promising path, suggested by the no-code ecosystem: use n8n or similar open-source platforms as the "teaching medium" (not the point), the way business schools use Excel — no one claims an MBA is "Excel training," but Excel is how you practice the concepts.

**What surprised us:**
- Consulting firms simply do not make training products. This was the most likely source of a hidden competitor, and it turned out to be empty. They consult; they do not teach.
- The Udemy no-code AI agent ecosystem is much larger and more mature than expected. n8n in particular has become a de facto teaching platform for non-coder agent building. Multiple courses with 10,000+ students.
- Zapier rebranded to "Zapier Agents" but has no formal training program — just product documentation. The training gap around their own product is filled by third-party Udemy instructors, not by Zapier itself.
- McKinsey and BCG publish sophisticated frameworks ("The Agentic Organization," "The Emerging Agentic Enterprise") that validate the exact transformation narrative Agents 102 uses. These are free marketing for the concept.

### Decide

**Is another round needed?** We are reaching diminishing returns.

Three rounds have mapped four distinct competitor categories across 15 programs. The gap that Agents 102 targets has been tested from every angle: developer bootcamps (Round 1), vendor product training (Round 2), consulting firms and no-code platforms (Round 3). Each round has confirmed the gap exists and sharpened its definition rather than finding it filled.

**What a Round 4 could investigate:**
- Corporate L&D platforms (LinkedIn Learning, Pluralsight, Skillsoft) — do they offer agentic AI content for business audiences?
- Community-driven programs (AI meetups, cohort-based courses like Maven) — grassroots competitors
- Regional/non-English programs — the competitive landscape may differ in Europe, Asia

**Recommendation: Stop here.** The marginal value of additional rounds is low. The core competitive picture is clear:
1. No one occupies Agents 102's specific position
2. The gap is real but hard to deliver
3. The competitive risk is not a direct competitor — it is vendor training absorbing demand before Agents 102 can reach buyers
4. Consulting firm thought leadership validates the concept and creates market awareness

Additional research energy is better spent on content development and pilot design than on mapping more competitors. The competitive intelligence is sufficient for positioning decisions.
