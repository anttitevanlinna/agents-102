# Business Model Canvas — Agents 102 Training (Scaling Model)

The training business. Value stream mapping / agentic business process re-engineering is a separate product line (see: agentic-rework-frameworks — not developed here).

## Design Principle

**Teach everyone to think. Scale for future. With your own structure.**

SAFe got the action right ("launch trains, train everyone") but the rigidity wrong (SAFe's trains, SAFe's structure, SAFe's certification — the company adapted to SAFe). We take the bias to action and fix the ownership: teach the meta-capability (thinking agents), build a capability that compounds (not a one-time event), and the company builds with their own structure (not ours).

**The network of companies is the product. The training is the forum that creates and compounds the network. We are the curator, not the authority.**

The authority on how to deploy agents lives in the collective experience of the network — not in us, not in any vendor, not in McKinsey. A bank trusts a logistics company that already deployed agents in a regulated environment more than it trusts any trainer or consultant. Peer validation is the highest-trust signal in enterprise decisions.

Our role: curate that collective intelligence. Distill it. Make it accessible. The training is the forum that brings orgs in and gives them shared language. The network is where trust and knowledge compound. The curated adaptation library — "here's how 30 companies actually handled agent security" — is the thing no vendor, no MOOC, and no consulting firm can produce. Only a network of peers who've done it can.

**Phase 1: Train.** Orgs enter the network. They adapt the framework to their reality. They build real agents with their real policies.

**Phase 2: Deploy best-in-class curated practices.** The network's collective experience, distilled and anonymized, becomes the most trusted source of agentic practice. Not our opinion — their peers' battle-tested results.

Think YPO, not SAFe. The events aren't the product — the peer network is. We are the curator, not the teacher.

## Customer Segments

### The builder leader

**Primary buyer:** CEO / CTO / SVP of HR who wants to own the transformation
- Personally frustrated with transformation theatre — governance frameworks, initiative lists, quarterly reviews that produce slides but no felt change
- Wants their organization to *have* the competence, not rent it from a consultancy
- Understands that when the consultancy leaves, the slides go stale — but when champions learn to think agents, the capability compounds
- Buys ownership, not advice

This is a psychographic, not a title. It's the leader who led their agile/digital transformation personally, not by hiring it out. The one who wants to understand, not just approve. The builder CEO.

**The contrast that sells:**

The Deloitte story: Board approves budget. Consultancy arrives. 6-month assessment. Governance framework. Initiative portfolio. 18 months in, nobody in leadership has ever seen an agent work with their company's data.

The Agents 102 story: Week 2, your people build a working agent with your security policies, on your processes. A champion demos it to leadership. The room shifts — not because of a slide, but because they saw the thing work. The vision emerges from building. The path appears when you start walking.

**Secondary buyer:** VP of Operations / Chief Digital Officer
- Owns process transformation
- Wants agent capability embedded in business teams, not siloed in IT
- Buys outcomes and ownership, not training hours

**End learner:** Non-technical business professionals
- Product managers, analysts, team leads, operations staff
- Not developers, but not afraid to learn
- Want to build, not just understand

**Not our customer:** Leaders who want to outsource their transformation to a consultancy (let them hire Deloitte). Individual developers (they have free vendor training). Executives who only want strategy decks.

## Value Propositions

### The core insight: without agent competence, there is no vision

Previous transformations — digital, agile, cloud — could be led from strategy alone. An executive didn't need to personally build software to envision a digital company. The vision was accessible through analysis. Consultancies could hand it down in slide decks, and governance could be applied top-down.

The agentic transformation is fundamentally different. You cannot envision what agents do for your organization if you cannot think agents. Without hands-on competence, leadership governs an abstraction:

- Deloitte's "agent sprawl" framework becomes a checklist about something nobody in the room understands
- McKinsey's "Factory vs Artisan" is meaningless if leadership can't imagine either pattern in their business
- IBM's "manage agents as workers" is a metaphor without substance if nobody has worked alongside an agent
- Governance structures govern nothing real. Initiative lists have no felt vision behind them. Maturity models describe levels nobody can picture.

**The consultancy frameworks are theatre without agent competence.** We are not the execution layer under their strategy. We are the prerequisite. The vision — the real one, not the slide deck — emerges from competence. Strategies emerge from action, not analysis.

This is where we conjecture momentum. Once people can think agents, the vision becomes obvious. It is not handed down from a strategy deck. It emerges from building.

**To the builder leader:**
- "Your McKinsey framework is governance of an abstraction until your people can think agents"
- "Join a network of companies figuring out agent adoption together — and deploy practices that are already proven by your peers"
- Your people learn with your real policies, your real systems, your real problems
- Phase 1: build the competence that makes your AI strategy real. Phase 2: access curated best practices from orgs who've already done it.
- Not our opinion on what works — peer-validated, battle-tested patterns

**To the learner:**
- Build working agents without writing code
- Understand agent patterns that transfer across any platform
- Become the person in your org who actually knows how this works — the one who makes the transformation real, not theoretical

**To the org:**
- Phase 1: Agent competence — the prerequisite for having a real agentic vision, not a governance slide deck
- Phase 2: Access to best-in-class agentic practices curated from the network
- Trust: these practices come from companies like yours, not from a vendor or consultant
- A living capability backed by a living network

## The Curriculum Model: Framework + Plug Points

The curriculum is not a fixed script. It's a **framework with plug points** — places where each organization inserts their own reality.

| Module area | We provide | The org plugs in |
|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| Agent patterns | Four agentic design patterns (reflection, tool use, planning, multi-agent) | Their use cases, their processes |
| Security & governance | Agent security principles, risk frameworks, failure modes | Their security policies, their compliance requirements, their data classification |
| Agent building | Hands-on exercises using no-code platforms | Their preferred tools (n8n, Zapier, Copilot Studio, whatever they use) |
| Deployment | Deployment patterns, monitoring, human-in-the-loop design | Their infrastructure, their approval processes, their SLAs |
| Ethics & boundaries | Agent ethics principles, boundary-setting patterns | Their values, their brand guidelines, their sensitive domains |
| Evaluation | How to assess agent quality and fitness | Their KPIs, their definition of success |

**This is the Phase 1 differentiator.** Vendor training teaches their product. MOOCs teach generic skills. Agents 102 teaches principles that the org makes real with their own context. The training output isn't a certificate — it's working agents built on the org's actual policies.

**The Phase 2 differentiator is the source of truth.** Once the org is in the network, they access curated practices from every other org's plug point adaptations. "Here's how 12 companies in regulated industries handled agent data access." That doesn't come from us — it comes from the network. We curate it. The trust comes from the peers.

---

## Channels

**Phase 1 — Direct delivery (we facilitate):**
- Direct engagement with mid-market and enterprise L&D
- Conference workshops and keynotes as lead generation
- Pilot cohorts with design partners (3-5 orgs)

**Phase 2 — Community-assisted (we + champions facilitate):**
- Champions co-facilitate inside their orgs, we support
- Cross-org community shares adaptations and learnings
- Partners (Nordic boutiques, independents) deliver with their own flavor

**Phase 3 — Community-led (champions facilitate, we maintain the framework):**
- Champions run it internally, adapted to their org
- Community of practice shares what works across orgs
- We maintain the core framework, absorb the best community adaptations back in

---

## Customer Relationships

**Communal, not contractual.** The relationship deepens through shared practice, not upsell pressure.

| Relationship type | How |
|-------------------|-----|
| Cohort delivery | Time-boxed programs with live facilitation, org-specific plug points |
| Champion growing | Ongoing peer support, not top-down coaching |
| Community of practice | Cross-org, peer-to-peer. Champions share adaptations, exercises, war stories |
| Framework evolution | Curriculum evolves through community input + landscape changes |

**We succeed when they don't need us for training anymore — and stay because they need the network.** The org owns their adapted version. Champions maintain and evolve it internally. They stay in the network because no individual org can replicate the collective intelligence of 50 peers deploying agents across different industries. We stay relevant as the curator of that intelligence.

## Revenue Streams

| Phase | What | Pricing model | Notes |
|-------|------|---------------|-------|
| Orient | Leadership workshop (1 day) | Per-session | Low barrier. Proves value. Gets buy-in. |
| Build | Cohort program (4-6 weeks) | Per-seat, cohort-based | Core revenue. Includes org-specific adaptation work. |
| Adapt | Plug point integration (we help integrate their policies, systems, context) | Per-engagement | This is the high-value customization. |
| Grow | Champion development | Per-seat | Not certification — development. Champions learn to facilitate and adapt. |
| Sustain | Network membership | Annual per-org | Access to the network: peer orgs, curated practices, adaptation library, updated framework |
| Curated practices | Best-in-class practice packs (e.g. "Agent Security in Regulated Industries") | Included in membership or per-pack | Synthesized from network data + our frontier research. The Phase 2 product. |

**Pricing logic:**
- Orient is accessible — low barrier, proves value, first taste of the network
- Build + Adapt is the entry fee — the cohort makes you a contributing member of the network
- Grow is investment in the org's multiplier capacity
- Sustain is network membership — you stay for the peers and the curated practices
- Curated practices are the Phase 2 value — best-in-class patterns distilled from the network's collective experience

**The long-term revenue is the network and its curated intelligence.** Training is how orgs enter (Phase 1). Curated best-in-class practices are why they stay (Phase 2). As more orgs deploy and share results, the curated practices get richer and more trusted — classic network economics.

**Not competing on price with MOOCs ($15) or free vendor training.** Competing on trust: peer-validated practices from companies who've actually done it.

---

## Our Role: Curator + Researcher

We curate the absolute best from two sources:

**1. Network intelligence** — peer companies' battle-tested adaptations. What actually worked when a bank deployed agent security. How a logistics company handled agent access to warehouse systems. Real orgs, real results.

**2. Our own frontier research** — we actively track what's happening at the edge of agentics. The Agentics Foundation, Claude Flow, new protocols (MCP, A2A), emerging patterns, academic research, open-source tooling. We synthesize this into practical guidance before it shows up in vendor training or MOOCs.

**The combination is the unique value.** No vendor tracks the full frontier (they track their own ecosystem). No consulting firm has the network data. No MOOC updates fast enough. We synthesize frontier research WITH network experience — "here's a new pattern emerging from the Agentics Foundation, and here's how 5 network companies have already started testing it."

| We do | We don't do |
|-------|-------------|
| Research the frontier — track foundations, protocols, emerging patterns | Prescribe how orgs should deploy agents |
| Curate the adaptation library — distill, anonymize, quality-check | Own the "right answer" — the network + research produce the answers |
| Synthesize frontier + network — connect what's emerging with what's proven | Gate-keep knowledge — the network's intelligence flows freely |
| Facilitate connections — match orgs facing similar challenges | Sell ongoing dependency — we succeed when they're self-sustaining |
| Run the forum (training) — the entry point into the network | Lag behind — the framework must reflect the frontier, not last year's patterns |

---

## Key Resources

| Resource | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Core framework + exercises | The entry point. Vendor-agnostic patterns, non-coder-accessible. Designed with plug points. |
| Research + curatorial capability | The real skill. Tracking the frontier (Agentics Foundation, protocols, tooling) AND distilling signal from network adaptations. |
| Facilitators who can adapt | Not script-readers. People who can work with an org's context on the fly. |
| No-code platform integrations | n8n, Zapier, etc. as hands-on labs. Org chooses their platform. |
| The network itself | The primary asset. Peer orgs, their champions, their trust relationships. |
| Adaptation library | Curated collection of how orgs adapted the framework. Anonymized, battle-tested. The network's collective intelligence made tangible. |

---

## Key Activities

| Activity | Cadence |
|----------|---------|
| Frontier research — track Agentics Foundation, protocols, tooling, academic work | Continuous |
| Deliver cohort programs | Ongoing |
| Adapt framework to new orgs (plug point integration) | Per engagement |
| Grow champions | Ongoing |
| Synthesize — merge frontier research with network experience into curated practices | Quarterly |
| Curate adaptation library | Ongoing (community-sourced) |
| Facilitate community of practice | Ongoing |

**The critical activity is the synthesis.** Frontier research alone is academic. Network experience alone is anecdotal. The synthesis — "here's what's emerging AND here's what's proven" — is what makes our curated practices the best available. This is the thing we must be excellent at.

**The second critical activity is growing the network.** More orgs = richer adaptation data = better curated practices = more attractive network. The flywheel.

---

## Key Partnerships

| Partner type | Role |
|-------------|------|
| No-code platforms | Hands-on lab environment. n8n, Zapier, Make. Org chooses. |
| Independent facilitators / boutique firms | Deliver with their own style. Not franchisees — peers. |
| Design partner orgs | Co-develop the framework through real use. First 3-5 orgs. |
| AI vendors | Case studies, guest expertise. Not exclusivity. |
| Community contributors | Champions who share adaptations back. The lifeblood. |

**No franchise model. No licensed delivery scripts.** Partners and champions adapt the framework to their context. We maintain the core. The relationship is peer, not parent-child.

---

## Cost Structure

| Cost | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Framework development | Fixed, upfront | Heaviest early investment. Must be excellent and adaptable. |
| Facilitator network | Variable, per-cohort | Experienced people, not cheap. Quality matters. |
| Adaptation work | Variable, per-org | Integrating plug points with org-specific context |
| Platform/tooling | Fixed, low | n8n is open source; others have free tiers |
| Framework maintenance | Fixed, quarterly | Keep core current with agent landscape |
| Community operations | Fixed, ongoing | Platform, events, curation |

**Cost structure has network economics.** Early: heavy investment in framework + first orgs (consulting-adjacent). As the network grows: adaptation cost per org drops because the library has more patterns to draw from. Champions deliver internally at zero cost to us. The network becomes self-reinforcing — more orgs contributing means less work per new org joining.

---

## The Flywheel

The network of companies is the flywheel. The training is the forum where it compounds.

```
Org joins the network (via training)
       ↓
Adapts framework to their reality (plug points)
       ↓
Deploys real agents with real policies
       ↓
Shares what worked (and what didn't) back to the network
       ↓
Other orgs learn from their adaptation — faster, cheaper, less risk
       ↓
Network becomes more valuable → attracts next org
```

**Every org that joins makes the network more valuable for every other org.** A logistics company shares how they handled agent access to warehouse systems. A bank shares their compliance plug points. A healthcare org shares their patient data boundaries. None of them compete with each other — they all face the same novel problem (agent adoption) and learn faster together than alone.

**The training is the forum** — the structured occasion where organizations enter the network, build shared language, and start contributing. Without the training, the network has no entry point. Without the network, the training is just another course.

**The moat is the network, the research, and the synthesis.** Anyone can teach agent patterns. No vendor tracks the full frontier (only their own). No consultant has 50 orgs' deployment data. No MOOC updates quarterly. We sit at the intersection: frontier research (Agentics Foundation, Claude Flow, emerging protocols) synthesized with real deployment experience from the network. "Here's a new pattern from the Agentics Foundation — and here's how 5 network companies tested it, what worked, and what didn't." No one else can produce that.

## Adjacent: Agentic Rework Frameworks

Not part of this canvas. Separate product line: value stream mapping → agentic business process re-engineering. Natural entry point when leadership asks "where should we deploy agents first?" Developed separately.
