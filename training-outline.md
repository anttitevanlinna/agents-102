# Agents 102 — Training Outline (Draft)

## Audience

Leaders who move first: CTOs, CEOs, heads of business functions, and the curious early movers willing to invest in understanding before directing.

Also: product managers, team leads, and practitioners who will become the multipliers — the people who carry the understanding forward and train the next wave.

## Training Arc

### Part 1: The Reality Check

**What's actually happening vs. what the press says.**

- The narrative: "everyone will build agents" — vendor demos, keynotes, board pressure
- The reality: a tiny technical elite builds agents today, everyone else is stuck
- The honest gap: there's no ready-made platform to scale agent creation (yet)
- Why this matters now: boards are asking, competitors are moving, the window is open

### Part 2: What Early Adopters Are Doing Right Now

**Look at the people who are already building agents — today.**

- Super early adopters: who are they, what tools are they using
- Claude Code, ChatGPT, Codex — the real workbenches, not the vendor demos
- Concrete examples: what does an agent look like when someone builds one for their work?
- The key insight: these are agents, running now, solving real problems

### Part 3: The Fundamentals — How Agents Work with LLMs

**Durable knowledge that outlasts any specific tool.**

- What an LLM actually does — plain language, no mysticism
- From chatbot to agent: what's the difference, mechanically?
- The building blocks: instructions, tools, memory, reasoning, action
- Giving an agent a task, boundaries, and judgment
- Where the limits are today

### Part 4: Hands-On — Experience It Yourself

**You don't truly get it until you've done it.**

- Guided exercise: build or direct your first agent (no coding required)
- See it work, see it fail, understand why
- The "aha moment" that changes how you think about what's possible

### Part 5: Scaling the Movement

**From "I get it" to "my organization gets it."**

- The multiplier model: why you can't train everyone, and don't need to
- How to explain agents to your team without jargon
- How to identify where agents create value in your domain
- Creating the next wave: from trained leader to internal champion
- Living with uncertainty: navigating what comes next without a fixed map

## Design Principles

- Fundamentals-first, not tool-first
- Show the real thing, not polished demos
- Honest about what we don't know
- Every participant leaves able to multiply the knowledge
- Hands-on is non-negotiable — understanding comes from doing
