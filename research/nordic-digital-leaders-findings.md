## Round 1 — 2026-02-15

### Observe

Searched for CDOs, CTOs, and Chief Digital Officers at large Nordic companies who have spoken publicly about AI agents, agentic AI, or AI transformation in 2025-2026. Found 8 leaders.

### Leaders Found

**1. S.N. — Chief Transformation Officer, SOK (Finnish retail cooperative)**
- Named Finland's IT and Digital Leader of the Year 2024
- At BLOOM 2025: "You can't buy a transformation." Built 800-person digital team. "It didn't happen by accident — it happened through clear direction, proper funding, and the right people."
- On Futurice podcast: technology is NOT the biggest obstacle — organizational structures and people are
- **Framing: Competence/people (PRIMARY)**

**2. K.S. — CIO, Nordic Investment Bank, Helsinki**
- At Gartner Symposium 2025: "We need to have the time and money to train our people." Urged delegates to enable staff to "play with AI tools daily."
- Acknowledged ROI of capability-building is hard to prove to finance
- **Framing: Competence/people (PRIMARY)**

**3. C-J.N. — former Chief Data Officer, ZEISS Group; now strategy advisor**
- Keynote at CDOIQ Nordic Symposium 2026 at Aalto: "AI Is Advancing Faster Than Corporate Culture Can Follow"
- Cites MIT's 2025 Iceberg study: "95% of enterprise AI pilots fail because they can't generate ROI. The culture is not ready. The tech is not the problem, it's the people and the processes."
- "The culture always starts from the top leadership."
- **Framing: Competence/people (PRIMARY)**

**4. E.E. — CTO, Ericsson, Sweden**
- At Davos 2026: "Agentic AI will redefine how telecom networks are built"
- Co-founded Sferical AI (Aug 2025) with AstraZeneca, Saab, SEB, Wallenberg Investments — sovereign Swedish AI infrastructure with embedded skills programs
- **Framing: Tools/platform (PRIMARY), but Sferical AI investment validates internal capability thesis**

**5. T.T. — CIO, Neste, Finland**
- CIO for 12+ years, leading digital transformation for Neste's shift from oil to renewables
- "The sheer speed of change and the need to continuously balance the portfolio" is the biggest challenge
- Speaker at CIO Nordic 2026
- **Framing: Strategy (PRIMARY)**

**6. T.T2. — Chief Digital Officer, Helen (Helsinki Energy), Finland**
- On Futurice podcast: AI and process optimization at Helen
- "The energy sector is turning digital native, and Helen wants to act as a trailblazer"
- Collaborates with Aalto University House of AI
- **Framing: Strategy (PRIMARY)**

**7. A.S. — Senior Technical Leader for Data, Analytics & AI, Volvo Cars, Sweden**
- MIT Sloan "Me, Myself, and AI" podcast — interdisciplinary innovation with AI
- Emphasizes AI innovation requires collaboration across disciplines, not just technical skills
- **Framing: Competence/people (PRIMARY)**

**8. S.K. — CEO, Norrin (formerly Cloud1), Finland**
- At CDOIQ Nordic 2025: introduced enterprise AI agents and prerequisites for hyper-automation
- Positioning as Nordic Enterprise AI vendor — useful as competitive signal, not buyer persona
- **Framing: Tools/platform (vendor)**

### Orient — Round 1

4 of 8 leaders frame the challenge primarily as competence/people. The strongest signals come from S.N. (SOK), K.S. (NIB), and C-J.N. (ex-ZEISS) — all explicitly rejecting the idea that transformation can be purchased or outsourced. The builder-leader psychographic is visible in public statements.

Key market signal: Sferical AI — 5 of Sweden's largest organizations jointly investing in sovereign AI infrastructure WITH embedded training. This validates the thesis that enterprises see internal AI capability as strategic.

CIO Nordic 2026 conference theme: "REIMAGINING THE ORGANIZATIONAL OS FOR THE AGENTIC AGE" with explicit agenda items on upskilling and capability-building.

## Round 2 — 2026-02-15

### Observe

Broadened search across all four Nordic countries, major companies, and conference speaker lists. Found 7 new leaders.

### Leaders Found

**9. H.S. — EVP Technology, Digital & Innovation, Equinor, Norway**
- At NHO conference (Jan 2026): "How AI agents will change the way we work." Equinor employees already use copilots, chatbots, and agentic AI. AI saved USD 130M in 2025 (cumulative $330M+).
- At production scale, not piloting
- **Framing: Operational results + work transformation**

**10. I.M. — SVP & Head of AI, Telenor Group, Norway**
- "The biggest opportunity (and risk) for us now is Agentic AI because Responsible AI needs to be reinvented."
- Leads group-wide AI upskilling programme (all employees across the group)
- Speaking at Techpoint 2026
- **Framing: Competence/people (PRIMARY)**

**11. A.R. — CDIO, Novo Nordisk, Denmark**
- Scaled from hundreds to 20,000 Copilot users. MIT Sloan published his approach.
- Three key challenges: "midcycle enthusiasm dip that can kill GenAI adoption," "function-specific needs that demand tailored training," "cultural resistance"
- Solution: champion networks, targeted enablement, adaptive governance. "Senior employees serving as unexpected change agents."
- **Framing: Competence/people (PRIMARY)**

**12. P.P. — Chief Digital Officer, Ingka Group / IKEA Retail, Sweden**
- Trained 3,000+ co-workers in AI literacy in 2024
- "We are committed to upskilling and reskilling employees — and to helping everyone navigate the changing landscape of AI, while preserving human dignity and agency."
- Speaks at Web Summit, CXOTalk, Shoptalk Europe
- **Framing: Competence/people (PRIMARY)**

**13. J.L. — Head of Digitalisation & AI, Scania Logistics, Sweden**
- Retired the separate digitalisation team. Embedded capability into cross-functional "capability teams" — "all competence needed for that particular delivery stream was put inside that team"
- Grew from 2,000 to 10,000 OpenAI licenses. 2026 ambition: AI literacy company-wide.
- **Framing: Competence/people (PRIMARY) — structural anti-theatre**

**14. K.T.D. — Chief AI Officer, Danske Bank, Denmark**
- Appointed June 2025. Previously CIO at Topdanmark where he shipped Europe's first customer-facing GenAI in insurance.
- At Danske Bank, 16,000 employees using GenAI monthly.
- **Framing: Strategy + tools, practitioner bias**

**15. S.A. — Head of Digital Customer Engagement, Nordea, Denmark/Nordics**
- Coined "Building the GenAI Muscle." Warned "high investment in GenAI during current decade could be wasted" without capability building.
- "Now is the time to train employees, put safeguards in place." Runs internal hackathons.
- **Framing: Competence/people (PRIMARY)**

### Orient — Round 2

**The competence framing is dominant and real.** 9 of 15 leaders across both rounds frame it primarily as a people/competence/culture challenge. This spans retail, banking, pharma, telecom, automotive, energy, and manufacturing. Both target segments — software-adjacent and traditional digitalizers — are represented.

**Critical market data:** BCG (Jan 2025) found only 19% of Nordic white-collar workers use GenAI weekly vs. 61% globally. Potential cost: 60+ billion EUR in lost GDP annually across the Nordics.

**Anti-theatre signals are strong.** J.L. (Scania) dissolved the separate digital team. S.A. (Nordea) warns about wasted investment. A.R. (Novo Nordisk) talks about "midcycle enthusiasm dips" and champion networks. S.N. (SOK) says "you can't buy a transformation." These are people who have lived through transformation theatre and are allergic to it.

**Agentic AI specifically** is still frontier — only H.S. (Equinor) and I.M. (Telenor) explicitly use "agentic AI" language publicly. Most others are in GenAI/Copilot territory. The gap between GenAI deployment and agentic AI capability is exactly where Agents 102 sits.

## Implications for Assumption Map

- **Assumption 3 (builder leader exists in volume):** Evidence upgraded. 9 named leaders at major Nordic companies publicly framing the challenge as competence/people — across both target segments (software-adjacent and traditional digitalizers). No longer a single-case hypothesis.
- **Assumption 5 (problem is competence, not strategy or tools):** 9/15 independently confirm this framing in public statements. Strong signal.
- **Assumption 10 (urgency):** BCG Nordic GenAI complacency data (19% vs 61% globally, EUR 60B+ GDP risk) plus production-scale deployments at Equinor/Novo Nordisk/Nordea signal real urgency.
- **Assumption 6 (prerequisite narrative resonates):** S.N.'s "you can't buy a transformation" and C-J.N.'s "95% of pilots fail — the tech is not the problem" are near-exact articulations of the Agents 102 positioning.
