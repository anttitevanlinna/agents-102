| **URL** | https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-for-everyone |
| **Type** | Short course / certificate |

**Description.** Andrew Ng's introductory course on generative AI aimed squarely at non-technical professionals. Covers what generative AI is, how it works at a conceptual level, and how to apply it in business. Part of the massive wave of 10.9 million genAI registrations on Coursera.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Target audience | Business leaders, managers, non-coders |
| Key topics | GenAI concepts, prompt engineering basics, business applications, societal impact |
| Format | Video lectures, quizzes, peer discussion |
| Duration | ~6 hours (self-paced) |
| Price | Free to audit; ~$49 for certificate (Coursera Plus eligible) |
| Enrollment | Part of 10.9M+ genAI registrations on Coursera; likely 500K+ individually |
| Rating | 4.8/5 (estimated from platform norms for Ng courses) |

**Scorecard (1-5)**

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Reputation | 5 | Andrew Ng brand is the gold standard for accessible AI education |
| Enrollment Scale | 5 | Millions-level reach via Coursera |
| Content Quality | 5 | Polished production, clear explanations, strong pedagogy |
| Completion/Engagement | 4 | Short duration helps completion; limited hands-on depth |
| Pricing Model | 5 | Free audit option removes barrier; certificate is affordable |
| AI/Agent Relevance | 2 | GenAI overview only — no agent-building, no agentic patterns |

**What makes it work.** Celebrity instructor, short commitment, free audit, and laser focus on making AI accessible to non-technical people. It is the proof that massive enrollment can come from the "explain it simply" approach.

**Lessons for Agents 102.** The accessibility-first model works at enormous scale. Our audience overlaps heavily. But Ng stops at awareness — he does not teach people to build anything. That is exactly the gap Agents 102 fills: from understanding to doing.

## 4. Agentic AI: Build AI Agents with LangGraph, CrewAI & MCP (Udemy)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Provider** | Udemy |
| **Platform** | Udemy |
| **URL** | https://www.udemy.com/topic/ai-agents/ (category page) |
| **Type** | Multi-framework agent course |

**Description.** Covers building AI agents across multiple frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAI, MCP). Positions itself as a practical, multi-tool approach to agentic AI rather than locking into one ecosystem. Recent release with fast enrollment growth.

## 6. Agentic AI — DeepLearning.AI (Andrew Ng)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Provider** | DeepLearning.AI / Andrew Ng |
| **Platform** | DeepLearning.AI (own platform) |
| **URL** | https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/agentic-ai/ |
| **Type** | Short course |

**Description.** Andrew Ng's dedicated course on agentic AI, teaching learners to build production-ready agentic applications. Covers four key agentic design patterns: Reflection (AI critiques its own work), Tool Use (connecting AI to databases and APIs), Planning (breaking complex tasks into executable steps), and Multi-Agent (coordinating multiple specialized AI systems). Moves from design patterns through to deployment and evaluation.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Target audience | Developers and technical practitioners (Python required) |
| Key topics | Reflection, tool use, planning, multi-agent patterns, deployment, evaluation |
| Format | Video lectures + hands-on coding exercises |
| Duration | Short course (~1-3 hours, DeepLearning.AI standard) |
| Price | Free |
| Enrollment | Not disclosed (DeepLearning.AI does not publish enrollment numbers) |
| Rating | Not available |

**Scorecard (1-5)**

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Reputation | 5 | Andrew Ng brand + DeepLearning.AI credibility |
| Enrollment Scale | 4 | DeepLearning.AI has massive reach; exact numbers undisclosed |
| Content Quality | 5 | Ng's courses are consistently polished and well-structured |
| Completion/Engagement | 4 | Short duration helps; hands-on coding keeps engagement |
| Pricing Model | 5 | Free — zero barrier to entry |
| AI/Agent Relevance | 5 | 100% agentic AI, covers the four canonical design patterns |

**What makes it work.** Andrew Ng finally bridges the gap between his "AI for Everyone" accessibility brand and hands-on agent-building. The four agentic design patterns (reflection, tool use, planning, multi-agent) provide a conceptual framework that is framework-agnostic. Free pricing removes all barriers.

**Lessons for Agents 102.** This is the closest thing to a direct competitor — Ng's brand, agent content, accessible framing. However, it still requires Python. The four design patterns framework is excellent pedagogy and Agents 102 should adopt similar conceptual scaffolding. The key differentiator: Agents 102 teaches these patterns to people who do not code.

## 7. AI Agents in LangGraph — DeepLearning.AI

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Provider** | DeepLearning.AI (taught by Harrison Chase of LangChain & Rotem Weiss of Tavily) |
| **Platform** | DeepLearning.AI |
| **URL** | https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/ai-agents-in-langgraph/ |
| **Type** | Short course |

**Description.** Teaches how to build an AI agent from scratch using Python and an LLM, then rebuild it using LangGraph. Covers LangGraph's components and how to combine them to build flow-based agentic applications. Co-taught by LangChain's founder.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Target audience | Python developers familiar with LLMs |
| Key topics | Agent building from scratch, LangGraph components, flow-based agent design |
| Format | Video + hands-on coding in Jupyter notebooks |
| Duration | ~1 hour (DeepLearning.AI short course) |
| Price | Free |
| Enrollment | Not disclosed |
| Rating | Not available |

**Scorecard (1-5)**

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Reputation | 4 | DeepLearning.AI platform + LangChain founder credibility |
| Enrollment Scale | 3 | Short courses have narrower reach than Ng's flagship courses |
| Content Quality | 4 | Framework creators teaching their own tools = authoritative |
| Completion/Engagement | 4 | ~1 hour is extremely completable |
| Pricing Model | 5 | Free |
| AI/Agent Relevance | 5 | 100% agent-focused, builds agents from scratch |

**What makes it work.** Ultra-short format (1 hour) means high completion. Learning from the framework creator ensures accuracy. Building an agent from scratch before using a framework teaches underlying principles.

**Lessons for Agents 102.** The "build from scratch, then use a tool" pedagogy is brilliant — it builds understanding before abstraction. Agents 102 could adapt this: first understand what an agent does conceptually, then use no-code tools to build one. The 1-hour format proves that meaningful agent education can be very compact.

## 8. 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course — Google / Kaggle

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Provider** | Google (via Kaggle) |
| **Platform** | Kaggle |
| **URL** | https://www.kaggle.com/learn-guide/5-day-agents |
| **Type** | Intensive short course (cohort-based) |

**Description.** A 5-day intensive course from Google covering AI agents, delivered through Kaggle. Part of Google's push to educate developers on building with their AI tools and models (Gemini ecosystem). Cohort-based structure with daily modules.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Target audience | Developers and data scientists |
| Key topics | AI agents, Google AI tools (Gemini), agent design patterns |
| Format | Daily modules with hands-on exercises on Kaggle |
| Duration | 5 days (cohort-paced) |
| Price | Free |
| Enrollment | Not disclosed (Kaggle has 15M+ registered users as a platform) |
| Rating | Not available |

**Scorecard (1-5)**

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Reputation | 5 | Google brand carries enormous weight |
| Enrollment Scale | 3 | Kaggle audience is large but this is a specific program |
| Content Quality | 4 | Google's technical education is consistently strong |
| Completion/Engagement | 4 | 5-day cohort format creates urgency and accountability |
| Pricing Model | 5 | Free |
| AI/Agent Relevance | 5 | 100% agent-focused |

**What makes it work.** Cohort-based pacing (5 days) creates social accountability that self-paced courses lack. Google brand + Kaggle community = built-in distribution. Free pricing aligns with Google's strategy of growing their AI ecosystem.

**Lessons for Agents 102.** The cohort model is worth studying. Cohort pacing drives completion rates far above self-paced MOOCs. A 5-day sprint format could work well for Agents 102's workshop-style delivery. However, this is vendor-locked to Google's Gemini ecosystem and requires coding — both are gaps Agents 102 can fill.

## 9. OpenAI Academy

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Provider** | OpenAI |
| **Platform** | OpenAI (own platform) |
| **URL** | https://academy.openai.com/ |
| **Type** | Multi-tier educational platform with certifications |

**Description.** OpenAI's official educational platform, offering courses and certifications across multiple levels of AI fluency — from prompt engineering basics to AI-enabled work to building with OpenAI APIs. Piloting certifications starting in late 2025/early 2026. Represents OpenAI's move into structured education rather than just documentation.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Target audience | Multi-tier: beginners to advanced developers |
| Key topics | Prompt engineering, AI-enabled work, building with OpenAI APIs, agents |
| Format | Courses + certifications |
| Duration | Varies by tier |
| Price | Not fully disclosed; expected mix of free and paid |
| Enrollment | Not disclosed (new platform) |
| Rating | Not available (new) |

**Scorecard (1-5)**

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Reputation | 5 | OpenAI brand is dominant in public AI awareness |
| Enrollment Scale | 3 | New platform, but OpenAI has massive brand reach to drive enrollment |
| Content Quality | 4 | First-party education from the model maker; inherently authoritative |
| Completion/Engagement | 3 | Too new to assess; certification incentive may help |
| Pricing Model | 3 | Pricing unclear; certifications likely paid |
| AI/Agent Relevance | 4 | Covers agents but within OpenAI ecosystem only |

**What makes it work.** First-party authority — nobody knows OpenAI's tools better than OpenAI. The certification model adds career value. Multi-tier design means they are reaching both non-technical and technical audiences, though the non-technical tier focuses on prompt engineering, not agent-building.

**Lessons for Agents 102.** OpenAI Academy is the clearest signal that AI companies are entering the education market directly. However, their education is inherently vendor-locked (you learn to build with OpenAI tools). Agents 102's vendor-agnostic, pattern-focused approach is a real differentiator. The multi-tier design is worth borrowing — different entry points for different audiences.

## 10. UT Austin AI Agents for Business Applications PG Program

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Provider** | University of Texas at Austin (McCombs School of Business) |
| **Platform** | UT Austin Online Executive Education |
| **URL** | https://onlineexeced.mccombs.utexas.edu/ai-agents-for-business-applications-online-course |
| **Type** | Post-graduate certificate program |

**Description.** A university-backed executive education program focused specifically on AI agents for business applications. Teaches GenAI, LLMs, and RAG to boost productivity, automate workflows, and build secure multi-agent systems for real business impact. Positioned at the intersection of technical literacy and business strategy.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Target audience | Business professionals, executives, product managers |
| Key topics | GenAI, LLMs, RAG, workflow automation, multi-agent systems, business applications |
| Format | Online executive education with projects |
| Duration | Multi-week (estimated 6-12 weeks, typical for exec ed) |
| Price | Premium (university exec ed pricing, likely $2,000-$5,000+) |
| Enrollment | Not disclosed |
| Rating | Not available |

**Scorecard (1-5)**

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Reputation | 5 | UT Austin / McCombs brand = strong executive credibility |
| Enrollment Scale | 2 | Executive education programs have small cohorts by design |
| Content Quality | 4 | University-backed, business-contextualized |
| Completion/Engagement | 4 | High-touch exec ed format drives completion |
| Pricing Model | 1 | Premium pricing excludes most individual learners |
| AI/Agent Relevance | 5 | Explicitly "AI Agents for Business Applications" |

**What makes it work.** University credential + explicit business focus. Targets exactly the audience that wants agents for business impact, not for engineering careers. The McCombs business school context means the framing is business-first.

**Lessons for Agents 102.** This is the closest competitor to Agents 102's positioning — AI agents for business people. However, it is priced at executive education levels ($2K-$5K+), making it inaccessible for most individual learners. Agents 102 can deliver a similar business-first, agents-for-non-coders value proposition at a fraction of the price. The existence of this program validates the audience — business professionals want to learn about AI agents — but the price point leaves massive room below it.

| **Type** | Learning path (3 courses) |

**Description.** Pluralsight's learning path on AI agents for productivity, comprising three courses: "Introduction to Developing AI Agents," "Creating Personal AI Agents," and "Using AI Agents for Productivity." Designed to help professionals understand, implement, and optimize AI agents to enhance productivity, reduce costs, and drive innovation across various industries.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Target audience | IT professionals, business technologists, team leads |
| Key topics | AI agent concepts, personal AI agents, productivity optimization with agents |
| Format | Video courses with hands-on exercises |
| Duration | ~3-6 hours total (estimated from 3-course path) |
| Price | Pluralsight subscription (~$29/month individual, enterprise pricing varies) |
| Enrollment | Not disclosed (Pluralsight does not publish per-path enrollment) |
| Rating | Not available |

**Scorecard (1-5)**

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Reputation | 4 | Pluralsight is a recognized corporate training brand |
| Enrollment Scale | 3 | Enterprise distribution is strong but individual reach is limited |
| Content Quality | 3 | Solid professional content; lacks the star-instructor factor |
| Completion/Engagement | 3 | Subscription model means content competes for attention with 7,000+ other courses |
| Pricing Model | 3 | Subscription adds up; free trial available but not free-to-audit |
| AI/Agent Relevance | 4 | Directly covers AI agents, but productivity framing suggests conceptual/usage focus rather than building |

**What makes it work.** Corporate distribution channel — Pluralsight is already in thousands of enterprise L&D budgets. The "productivity" framing appeals to managers who need to justify learning time. Three-course path gives structure without overwhelming commitment.

**Lessons for Agents 102.** Pluralsight reaches the corporate audience Agents 102 wants, but through a subscription model that buries individual courses in a massive catalog. The "productivity" framing is instructive — corporate buyers want ROI language, not technical depth. However, this path appears to focus on understanding and using agents, not building them. The build gap persists even in corporate L&D.

## 12. Integrating AI Agents in Enterprise Systems — Pluralsight

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Provider** | Pluralsight |
| **Platform** | Pluralsight |
| **URL** | https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/integrating-ai-agents-enterprise-systems |
| **Type** | Individual course |

**Description.** Teaches how to design, implement, and scale AI agents that drive business value across departments (HR, finance, customer service). Covers building AI agents using Salesforce Agentforce and Amazon Bedrock. Enterprise-focused with vendor-specific platform integrations.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Target audience | Enterprise architects, IT leaders, developers in enterprise settings |
| Key topics | Enterprise AI agent design, Salesforce Agentforce, Amazon Bedrock, cross-department deployment |
| Format | Video course with demos |
| Duration | ~2-4 hours (estimated) |
| Price | Pluralsight subscription (~$29/month individual, enterprise pricing varies) |
| Enrollment | Not disclosed |
| Rating | Not available |

**Scorecard (1-5)**

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Reputation | 4 | Pluralsight enterprise credibility + Salesforce/AWS tool coverage |
| Enrollment Scale | 2 | Niche enterprise audience |
| Content Quality | 3 | Vendor-specific content (Agentforce, Bedrock) is practical but narrowing |
| Completion/Engagement | 3 | Short duration helps; enterprise learners often mandated to complete |
| Pricing Model | 3 | Subscription model |
| AI/Agent Relevance | 4 | Agent-focused but locked to enterprise vendor tools |

**What makes it work.** Speaks directly to enterprise IT decision-makers in their language: departments, business value, vendor platforms they already use. The Salesforce Agentforce and Amazon Bedrock coverage means learners can immediately apply knowledge in their existing enterprise stack.

**Lessons for Agents 102.** Enterprise agent education is vendor-locked by design — enterprises use Salesforce or AWS, so they learn those tools. Agents 102 cannot compete on vendor-specific depth but can compete on breadth and conceptual understanding. A business leader who understands agentic patterns first will make better decisions about which enterprise tools to adopt. Agents 102 is the "before you buy" education; Pluralsight is the "after you buy" training.

## 13. AI Agents and Automation (No Code): n8n, Zapier, APIs, RAGs — Udemy

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Provider** | Udemy (independent instructor) |
| **Platform** | Udemy |
| **URL** | https://www.udemy.com/course/ai-agents-and-automation/ |
| **Type** | Project-based course |

**Description.** A no-code-focused course teaching AI agents and automation using n8n, Zapier, APIs, and RAG techniques. Explicitly targets learners without coding backgrounds. Covers building AI agents that connect tools like Gmail, Google Sheets, Slack, and Discord to create practical business automations.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Target audience | Non-coders, business professionals, solopreneurs, automation enthusiasts |
| Key topics | No-code AI agents, n8n workflows, Zapier automations, RAG, API integrations |
| Format | Video lectures + hands-on projects |
| Duration | ~10-15 hours (estimated) |
| Price | ~$15-$90 (Udemy pricing) |
| Enrollment | Not disclosed in search results (likely <10K based on recency) |
| Rating | Not available from search data |

**Scorecard (1-5)**

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Reputation | 2 | Independent instructor on Udemy; no brand recognition |
| Enrollment Scale | 2 | Newer course; likely modest enrollment so far |
| Content Quality | 3 | Covers the right tools (n8n, Zapier) but quality unverified |
| Completion/Engagement | 3 | Hands-on projects help; moderate duration |
| Pricing Model | 4 | Udemy discount model keeps it affordable |
| AI/Agent Relevance | 5 | Directly teaches no-code AI agent building — closest to Agents 102's positioning |

**What makes it work.** Explicitly says "no code" in the title — directly targeting the underserved audience. Uses real no-code platforms (n8n, Zapier) that learners can immediately use. Combines agents with automation, which is the practical frame non-coders understand.

**Lessons for Agents 102.** This is the first course found across three rounds that directly occupies the "no-code AI agents" positioning. It is a signal that the market is starting to respond to the gap we identified. However, it is from an unknown instructor with no brand, likely modest enrollment, and unknown quality. The whitespace is being noticed but not yet claimed by a credible player. Agents 102 needs to move before this category fills up. The tool-first framing (n8n + Zapier) is both a strength (practical) and a weakness (platform-locked, not conceptual). Agents 102 can differentiate by teaching patterns first, tools second.

## 14. n8n - AI Agents, AI Automations & AI Voice Agents (No-code!) — Udemy

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Provider** | Udemy (independent instructor) |
| **Platform** | Udemy |
| **URL** | https://www.udemy.com/course/n8n-course/ |
| **Type** | Platform-specific course |

**Description.** A dedicated n8n course covering AI agents, AI automations, and AI voice agents — all without code. Teaches powerful automations step-by-step, designed for people who want to streamline business tasks or explore agentic AI with no prior coding experience.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Target audience | Non-coders, small business owners, automation beginners |
| Key topics | n8n platform, AI agents, workflow automation, AI voice agents |
| Format | Video lectures + step-by-step tutorials |
| Duration | ~10-20 hours (estimated) |
| Price | ~$15-$90 (Udemy pricing) |
| Enrollment | Not disclosed |
| Rating | Not available from search data |

**Scorecard (1-5)**

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Reputation | 2 | Unknown instructor; niche n8n focus |
| Enrollment Scale | 2 | Likely modest |
| Content Quality | 3 | Platform-specific depth can be high; conceptual breadth likely low |
| Completion/Engagement | 3 | Step-by-step tutorials are engaging for hands-on learners |
| Pricing Model | 4 | Udemy discount model |
| AI/Agent Relevance | 4 | Teaches AI agents but locked to a single platform (n8n) |

**What makes it work.** Single-platform focus means deep, practical knowledge. n8n is arguably the most capable no-code agent platform in 2026. "No-code" positioning is explicit and intentional.

**Lessons for Agents 102.** Platform-specific courses like this are tool training, not agent education. They teach "how to use n8n" not "what is an agent and why does it matter." Agents 102's value is the conceptual layer above: understanding agent patterns, evaluating tools, designing agent systems — then using platforms like n8n as implementation vehicles. These courses are complementary, not competitive.

| **Type** | Platform documentation and templates as de facto education |

**Description.** n8n's own AI agents page serves as a learning resource, offering customizable agent templates, documentation on building production-ready AI agents, and integration guides for 1,000+ tools. Not a formal course but functions as a self-service learning path for non-coders who want to build agents. Combines "learn by doing" with template-based education.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Target audience | Technical team members, automation builders, no-code/low-code practitioners |
| Key topics | AI agent workflows, tool integrations, template-based agent building, production deployment |
| Format | Documentation + templates + community forums |
| Duration | Self-paced, ongoing |
| Price | Free (n8n has free tier; cloud plans from $24/month) |

**Scorecard (1-5)**

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Market Reputation | 4 | n8n is the leading open-source automation platform; strong developer community |
| Enrollment Scale | 3 | Large community but not measured as "enrollment" |
| Content Quality | 3 | Practical and up-to-date; lacks pedagogical structure |
| Completion/Engagement | 2 | No structured path; learner must self-direct |
| Pricing Model | 5 | Free platform tier + free educational content |
| AI/Agent Relevance | 5 | Directly about building AI agents, no code required |

**What makes it work.** The platform IS the learning environment. Learners build real agents while learning. Templates lower the barrier to entry dramatically — clone a template, modify it, learn by doing. This is the most natural "no-code agent education" experience available today, even though it is not packaged as a course.

**Lessons for Agents 102.** n8n's template-based approach is the strongest informal competitor to Agents 102 for the non-coder audience. A motivated person can learn to build agents on n8n without taking any course — just follow the templates and docs. However, n8n teaches n8n, not agents. There is no conceptual framework, no vendor-agnostic thinking, no strategic layer. Agents 102 provides the "why" and "what" that makes the "how" (which n8n teaches) meaningful. The relationship is complementary: Agents 102 could recommend n8n as a hands-on implementation tool.
