# Agents 102 — Content Strategy

## The Problem

Everyone says agents will be the big thing. The press is full of it. Vendors are selling it. Boards are asking about it.

But the reality is stark: only a tiny group of deeply technical people can actually build agents today. You need software engineering skills, the right tooling, and hard-won experience with LLMs. Meanwhile, every business function — HR, finance, ops, marketing — is being asked "how's your AI transformation going?" and they don't have a good answer.

The big consulting firms are hedging. Companies are stuck. The gap between the narrative and the reality is enormous.

## Who Moves First

Leaders. The CTO, the CEO, the heads of business functions. They move first — not by building agents themselves, but by understanding what's actually happening.

They need to look outward at the super early adopters. These aren't people waiting for enterprise platforms. They're using Claude Code, ChatGPT, Codex — automating their lives and businesses right now. The things running in Claude Code today? Those are agents. Real ones, solving real problems.

Leaders need to understand:
- What is happening right now (not the hype — the reality)
- What will be possible in 6 months
- What will be possible in 12 months

Once the leaders get it, they can move. And once they move, they can scale.

## The Scaling Challenge

You cannot train everyone at €1000/head. It's too expensive and too slow.

The answer is a multiplier model:
1. Train the first wave — leaders and early movers who invest deeply
2. Those people become carriers — they don't just know about agents, they *get it*
3. They train and pull the next wave forward
4. Critical mass creates a movement — the culture shifts

The training doesn't just teach. It creates people who can multiply the understanding across their organization. Every graduate should be able to explain agents without jargon, show a real example, guide someone through their first experience, and make the case for where agents create value in their domain.

## What We Teach

The fundamentals of making agents with LLMs.

There is no ready-made platform that just enables agent creation at scale. Not yet. But the fundamentals are teachable, durable, and transferable:

- What an LLM actually does (demystified, no jargon)
- How you go from "a chatbot" to "an agent" — what changes, mechanically
- What tools, memory, and reasoning mean in practice
- How to give an agent a task, boundaries, and judgment
- What early adopters are doing right now with real tools

This is fundamentals-first, not tool-first. Tools will change. Platforms will mature. The person who understands how LLMs power agents will adapt to whatever comes next.

## The Undertone: Embracing Uncertainty

Most AI training sells certainty: five steps, a roadmap, a framework. That's comforting but dishonest.

This training is honest: **we don't know exactly where this is going.** Nobody does. The future will be lots of agents, created by lots of people and teams, in ways we can't fully predict.

But we do know that agents are being built right now, by real people, solving real problems. The future will be shaped by those who start moving — experimenting, learning, adapting — even without a complete map.

The skill isn't predicting the future. It's learning to move through uncertainty.

This honesty builds trust. The leaders in the room know that anyone promising certainty is lying.

## The Value Proposition

**We enable leaders to scale AI agent transformation across their organizations.**

Not by handing them a finished system. Not by promising a roadmap that doesn't exist. But by giving them the fundamentals, showing them what's real today, and equipping them to keep navigating as this evolves.

Honest confidence, not false certainty.
