# Agents 102

Training program for building AI agents. The network of companies is the product. The training is the forum.

**Value prop:** Teach everyone to think. Scale for future. With your own structure.

**Buyer:** The builder leader — CEO/CTO/SVP HR who wants to own the transformation, not outsource it. Psychographic, not a title.

**Core insight:** The agentic transformation is different from digital/agile/cloud. Without agent competence, there is no vision — just governance of an abstraction. We are the prerequisite, not the complement.

**Model:** Framework + plug points. Companies integrate their own policies, systems, and context. We are the curator + researcher, not the authority. The network's collective experience is the authority.

**Key files:**
- Business model canvas: `strategy/business-model-canvas.md`
- Content strategy: `content-strategy.md`
- Training outline: `training-outline.md`
- Learning goals: `learning-goals.md`
- All research: `research/` directory (see MEMORY.md for index)
- Next workstreams: see `memory/next-workstreams.md` (in Claude memory dir)

**Bosser identity:** "The best strategies emerge from action, not analysis." Framework-integrative, not framework-driven. See Bosser site at `/Users/anttitevanlinna/Projects/bosser/docs/index.html`.

## Project guidelines

- This is an educational project, not a software product
- Prioritize clarity and accessibility over technical depth
- Explain concepts in plain language first, then add technical detail where needed
- Use practical, real-world examples that resonate with business contexts
- Keep exercises hands-on and achievable without prior coding experience
- Framework-integrative, not framework-driven — frameworks serve the situation
- Research uses OODA loops — see `research/competitor-research-prompts.md` for methodology
- This is independent intellectual property — see COPYRIGHT.md for details
