# Business Model Canvas — Agents 102 Training (Scaling Model)

The training business. Value stream mapping / agentic business process re-engineering is a separate product line (see: agentic-rework-frameworks — not developed here).

## Design Principle

**Teach everyone to think. Scale for future. With your own structure.**

SAFe got the action right ("launch trains, train everyone") but the rigidity wrong (SAFe's trains, SAFe's structure, SAFe's certification — the company adapted to SAFe). We take the bias to action and fix the ownership: teach the meta-capability (thinking agents), build a capability that compounds (not a one-time event), and the company builds with their own structure (not ours).

**The network of companies is the product. The training is the forum that creates and compounds the network. We are the curator, not the authority.**

The authority on how to deploy agents lives in the collective experience of the network — not in us, not in any vendor, not in McKinsey. A bank trusts a logistics company that already deployed agents in a regulated environment more than it trusts any trainer or consultant. Peer validation is the highest-trust signal in enterprise decisions.

Our role: curate that collective intelligence. Distill it. Make it accessible. The training is the forum that brings orgs in and gives them shared language. The network is where trust and knowledge compound. The curated adaptation library — "here's how 30 companies actually handled agent security" — is the thing no vendor, no MOOC, and no consulting firm can produce. Only a network of peers who've done it can.

Three things, in order: **Train → Curate → Connect.**

**Train.** Orgs enter. They build real agents with their real policies. The vision emerges from competence, not from a slide deck.

**Curate.** We track the frontier and distill what works and what doesn't. 80% from the best public sources, 20% from the peer network's specific experience.

**Connect.** The peer network is the long-term product. Companies doing the same transformation, learning from each other. Think YPO, not SAFe. The events aren't the product — the peer network is.

## Customer Segments

### The builder leader

**Primary buyer:** CEO / CTO / SVP of HR who wants to own the transformation
- Personally frustrated with transformation theatre — governance frameworks, initiative lists, quarterly reviews that produce slides but no felt change
- Wants their organization to *have* the competence, not rent it from a consultancy
- Understands that when the consultancy leaves, the slides go stale — but when champions learn to think agents, the capability compounds
- Buys ownership, not advice

This is a psychographic, not a title. It's the leader who led their agile/digital transformation personally, not by hiring it out. The one who wants to understand, not just approve. The builder CEO.

**The contrast that sells:**

The Deloitte story: Board approves budget. Consultancy arrives. 6-month assessment. Governance framework. Initiative portfolio. 18 months in, nobody in leadership has ever seen an agent work with their company's data.

The Agents 102 story: Week 2, your people build a working agent with your security policies, on your processes. A champion demos it to leadership. The room shifts — not because of a slide, but because they saw the thing work. The vision emerges from building. The path appears when you start walking.

**Secondary buyer:** VP of Operations / Chief Digital Officer
- Owns process transformation
- Wants agent capability embedded in business teams, not siloed in IT
- Buys outcomes and ownership, not training hours

**End learner:** Non-technical business professionals
- Product managers, analysts, team leads, operations staff
- Not developers, but not afraid to learn
- Want to build, not just understand

**Not our customer:** Leaders who want to outsource their transformation to a consultancy (let them hire Deloitte). Individual developers (they have free vendor training). Executives who only want strategy decks.

---

## Value Propositions

### The core insight: without agent competence, there is no vision

Previous transformations — digital, agile, cloud — could be led from strategy alone. An executive didn't need to personally build software to envision a digital company. The vision was accessible through analysis. Consultancies could hand it down in slide decks, and governance could be applied top-down.

The agentic transformation is fundamentally different. You cannot envision what agents do for your organization if you cannot think agents. Without hands-on competence, leadership governs an abstraction:

- Deloitte's "agent sprawl" framework becomes a checklist about something nobody in the room understands
- McKinsey's "Factory vs Artisan" is meaningless if leadership can't imagine either pattern in their business
- IBM's "manage agents as workers" is a metaphor without substance if nobody has worked alongside an agent
- Governance structures govern nothing real. Initiative lists have no felt vision behind them. Maturity models describe levels nobody can picture.

**The consultancy frameworks are theatre without agent competence.** We are not the execution layer under their strategy. We are the prerequisite. The vision — the real one, not the slide deck — emerges from competence. Strategies emerge from action, not analysis.

This is where we conjecture momentum. Once people can think agents, the vision becomes obvious. It is not handed down from a strategy deck. It emerges from building.

**To the builder leader:**
- "Your McKinsey framework is governance of an abstraction until your people can think agents"
- "Join a network of companies figuring out agent adoption together — and deploy practices that are already proven by your peers"
- Your people learn with your real policies, your real systems, your real problems
- Phase 1: build the competence that makes your AI strategy real. Phase 2: access curated best practices from orgs who've already done it.
- Not our opinion on what works — peer-validated, battle-tested patterns

**To the learner:**
- Build working agents without writing code
- Understand agent patterns that transfer across any platform
- Become the person in your org who actually knows how this works — the one who makes the transformation real, not theoretical

**To the org:**
- Phase 1: Agent competence — the prerequisite for having a real agentic vision, not a governance slide deck
- Phase 2: Access to best-in-class agentic practices curated from the network
- Trust: these practices come from companies like yours, not from a vendor or consultant
- A living capability backed by a living network

## The Curriculum Model: Framework + Plug Points

The curriculum is not a fixed script. It's a **framework with plug points** — places where each organization inserts their own reality.

| Module area | We provide | The org plugs in |
|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| Agent patterns | Four agentic design patterns (reflection, tool use, planning, multi-agent) | Their use cases, their processes |
| Security & governance | Agent security principles, risk frameworks, failure modes | Their security policies, their compliance requirements, their data classification |
| Agent building | Hands-on exercises using no-code platforms | Their preferred tools (n8n, Zapier, Copilot Studio, whatever they use) |
| Deployment | Deployment patterns, monitoring, human-in-the-loop design | Their infrastructure, their approval processes, their SLAs |
| Ethics & boundaries | Agent ethics principles, boundary-setting patterns | Their values, their brand guidelines, their sensitive domains |
| Evaluation | How to assess agent quality and fitness | Their KPIs, their definition of success |

**This is the Phase 1 differentiator.** Vendor training teaches their product. MOOCs teach generic skills. Agents 102 teaches principles that the org makes real with their own context. The training output isn't a certificate — it's working agents built on the org's actual policies.

**The Phase 2 differentiator is the source of truth.** Once the org is in the network, they access curated practices from every other org's plug point adaptations. "Here's how 12 companies in regulated industries handled agent data access." That doesn't come from us — it comes from the network. We curate it. The trust comes from the peers.

---

## Channels

**Train:** Direct engagement with enterprise L&D and digital leaders. Conference workshops as lead generation. Pilot cohorts with design partners (3-5 orgs). The €500 intensive is the lowest-friction entry.

**Curate:** Practice packs and synthesis delivered digitally to network members. Frontier research published continuously. The proto-practice pack can start before the network exists — curated from public sources.

**Connect:** Peer forums (dinners, firesides), cross-org community, champion networks. Partners (Nordic boutiques, independents) deliver training with their own flavor — not franchisees, peers.

**Delivery evolution over time:**
- Early: we facilitate everything directly
- Growth: we + champions co-facilitate, champions run adapted versions internally
- Scale: champions facilitate, we maintain framework + curate + connect

---

## Customer Relationships

**Communal, not contractual.** The relationship deepens through shared practice, not upsell pressure.

| Relationship type | How |
|-------------------|-----|
| Cohort delivery | Time-boxed programs with live facilitation, org-specific plug points |
| Champion growing | Ongoing peer support, not top-down coaching |
| Community of practice | Cross-org, peer-to-peer. Champions share adaptations, exercises, war stories |
| Framework evolution | Curriculum evolves through community input + landscape changes |

**We succeed when they don't need us for training anymore — and stay because they need the network.** The org owns their adapted version. Champions maintain and evolve it internally. They stay in the network because no individual org can replicate the collective intelligence of 50 peers deploying agents across different industries. We stay relevant as the curator of that intelligence.

---

## What We Sell — Three Things

Everything we do is one of three things: **Train**, **Curate**, or **Connect**. In that order — because each enables the next.

### 1. TRAIN — Build agent competence

The entry point. People learn to think agents by building real ones with their org's own policies.

| Step | What | Pricing | Who |
|------|------|---------|-----|
| **Bootstrap** | 2-day hands-on intensive | **€500/person** | Anyone. 20 people × €500 = €10K — better than consulting day rates, and you create 20 capable people instead of one deliverable. |
| **Make Your Own** | 4-6 week cohort + change strategy lab | Per-seat, cohort-based | For orgs that want to move fast. Plug points (their policies, systems, context) AND change strategy: a few key change leaders design the rollout with mentoring. Not just "we learned agents" — "we have a plan to transform." |
| **Champions** | Train-the-trainer | Per-seat | The best from Bootstrap. They learn to facilitate, adapt, and carry it forward inside their org. |
| **Scale** | Champions run it internally | Zero cost to us | Champions train their org with their own structure. We support, they deliver. |
| **Drive into Value Chains** | Agentic rework + peer network | Annual per-org | Map value chains, identify where agents create real value. Learn from peers who've driven agents into similar processes. Curated practices + peer forums are the fuel. |

The €500 Bootstrap is a steal — and that's deliberate. The goal is to get people building. Once they build, the vision emerges. The best from Bootstrap become Champions. Champions take it home and Scale. The Network is why they stay connected.

### 2. CURATE — Know what works and what doesn't

The 80/20 model. We curate the best agentic practices from two sources:

- **80% frontier research** — public case studies, conference talks, open-source patterns, published deployments, protocol developments (MCP, A2A), academic work. We track the frontier continuously and distill it into practical guidance. Knowing what works and what doesn't is the core skill.
- **20% peer premium** — specific, contextual, "how we actually handled it at our company" detail from the network. Anonymized, curated, quality-checked. The thing no public source provides.

The combination is the unique value. No vendor tracks the full frontier (only their own ecosystem). No consultant has 30 orgs' deployment data. No MOOC updates fast enough. We synthesize frontier research WITH peer experience.

**Output:** Practice packs (e.g. "Agent Security in Regulated Industries"), quarterly synthesis reports, updated framework modules.

### 3. CONNECT — Peer network of companies

The long-term product. Companies doing the same transformation, learning from each other.

| What | Format | Pricing |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Network membership** | Annual per-org | Access to peer orgs, curated practices, adaptation library, updated framework |
| **Peer forums** | Dinners, firesides, off-the-record sessions | Designed for how executives naturally share — not structured data collection |
| **Practice sharing** | Anonymized case exchange | Reciprocity-based — you get because you give |

## The Customer Journey — Five Steps

```
1. BOOTSTRAP (2-day intensive, €500/person)
   "I see what agents can do. I built one."
       ↓
2. MAKE YOUR OWN (cohort + change strategy lab, 4-6 weeks)
   "We're building agents with our policies AND designing our change strategy."
   A few key change leaders work with mentoring to plan the rollout.
       ↓
3. CHAMPIONS (train-the-trainer)
   The best people from Bootstrap join. They learn to facilitate,
   adapt the framework, and train the next wave inside their org.
       ↓
4. SCALE (champions run it internally)
   Champions train their org — with their own structure, not ours.
   The capability multiplies without us in the room.
       ↓
5. DRIVE INTO VALUE CHAINS (agentic rework)
   The org has agent competence. Now: where does it create real value?
   Map your value chains. Identify where agents transform the work.
   Learn from peers who've already driven agents into similar processes.
   The peer network + curated practices are the fuel for this step.
```

**The natural flow:** Bootstrap is the door — anyone can walk in. Make Your Own is where change leaders design the rollout. The best from Bootstrap become Champions. Champions Scale it inside the org. Then the real work begins: driving agents into the value chains where they create actual business value — learning from peers who've already done it.

**Not every org takes every step.** Some will do Bootstrap and stop. That's fine — €500 is a standalone that delivers real value, not a teaser. But the pull is forward: once you build, you want your org to build. Once your org builds, you want to rework your value chains. Once you rework value chains, you want to know how 30 other companies did it.

---

## The Economics

### Blue ocean pricing

This is not priced against training competitors (MOOCs at €15, vendor training at €0, Aalto EE at €5K/person). It's priced against the alternative: consulting.

| Step | Investment | Consulting equivalent | What you get instead |
|------|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Bootstrap | 20 × €500 = **€10K** | 4-6 days of one consultant | 20 people who can think agents |
| Make Your Own | **€25-40K** flat (5-10 change leaders) | 4-6 weeks of one senior consultant (€32-48K) | 5-10 capable change leaders + change strategy + working agents on your policies |
| Champions | 5 × €3-5K = **€15-25K** | Ongoing consulting dependency | 5 internal trainers who scale it without us |
| Scale | **€0** | More consulting | Champions run it — your structure, your pace |
| **Total** | **~€50-75K** | €200-500K (McKinsey) or €100-300K/yr (Solita/Reaktor) | Org-wide competence + strategy + internal trainers + independence |

**The pricing logic:**
- Bootstrap is a steal — deliberately. Get people building. The vision emerges from action.
- Make Your Own is priced as a transformation engagement, not a training course. Flat per-org, not per-seat. Includes mentoring.
- Champions is the multiplier investment. 5 people × €4K = €20K → they train 200 people internally at zero additional cost.
- Scale is free. Charging for Scale would be taxing their success. The capability is theirs.
- Drive into Value Chains (Step 5) is where ongoing revenue lives — network membership, curated practices, peer forums.

**For a large Nordic company** (DNA, S-Group, Finnair): ~€60K is 1-3% of L&D budget. Less than one senior consultant for a year. And the capability stays — permanently.

### Co-branded, co-copyright

All training materials are **co-branded** with the customer's identity and delivered with **co-copyright for further development**. The org doesn't license our materials — they co-own them.

**Why this matters:**
- **"With your own structure"** — literally. The materials are theirs to adapt, extend, and evolve.
- **Anti-SAFe by design.** SAFe locks you into their IP, their certification, their materials. We give you co-ownership. No dependency.
- **Champions are more effective** because they can freely adapt materials for their context — no "check with headquarters" friction.
- **The capability truly stays.** Not just the people, but the training materials themselves. If you stop working with us, you still have everything.
- **Natural lock-in without lock-in.** Once co-branded materials are embedded in internal L&D, they become part of the org's infrastructure. The switching cost is high — but it doesn't feel like lock-in because they own it.

This is the opposite of the consulting model (deliverable stays, consultants leave, IP is theirs but dependency remains) and the opposite of the certification model (IP stays with the certifying body, you pay annually to use it). We give away the IP and keep the relationship — because the relationship (network, curation, frontier research) is more valuable than the materials.

**Revenue builds in layers:**
- Training revenue is immediate and repeatable
- Co-branded materials create embedded presence inside the org
- Network membership is recurring (Step 5)
- Curated practices compound in value as the network grows
- Champions delivering internally = zero marginal cost to us

**The long-term revenue is the network and its curated intelligence.** Training is how orgs enter. Co-branded materials are how we embed. Curated practices are why they stay.

---

## Our Role: Curator + Researcher (the 80/20 model)

We curate what works and what doesn't from two sources:

**80% frontier research** — we actively track what's happening at the edge of agentics. The Agentics Foundation, Claude Flow, new protocols (MCP, A2A), emerging patterns, academic research, open-source tooling, public case studies, conference talks. We synthesize this into practical guidance before it shows up in vendor training or MOOCs. This is the volume — and it's within our control.

**20% peer premium** — the network's specific, contextual experience. What actually worked when a bank deployed agent security. How a logistics company handled agent access to warehouse systems. Anonymized, curated, quality-checked. The detail that no public source provides.

**The combination is the unique value.** No vendor tracks the full frontier (they track their own ecosystem). No consultant has 30 orgs' deployment data. No MOOC updates fast enough. We synthesize frontier research WITH peer experience. The 80% makes us useful from day one. The 20% makes us irreplaceable over time.

| We do | We don't do |
|-------|-------------|
| Research the frontier — track foundations, protocols, emerging patterns | Prescribe how orgs should deploy agents |
| Curate the adaptation library — distill, anonymize, quality-check | Own the "right answer" — the network + research produce the answers |
| Synthesize frontier + network — connect what's emerging with what's proven | Gate-keep knowledge — the network's intelligence flows freely |
| Facilitate connections — match orgs facing similar challenges | Sell ongoing dependency — we succeed when they're self-sustaining |
| Run the forum (training) — the entry point into the network | Lag behind — the framework must reflect the frontier, not last year's patterns |

---

## Key Resources

| Resource | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Core framework + exercises | The entry point. Vendor-agnostic patterns, non-coder-accessible. Designed with plug points. |
| Research + curatorial capability | The real skill. Tracking the frontier (Agentics Foundation, protocols, tooling) AND distilling signal from network adaptations. |
| Facilitators who can adapt | Not script-readers. People who can work with an org's context on the fly. |
| No-code platform integrations | n8n, Zapier, etc. as hands-on labs. Org chooses their platform. |
| The network itself | The primary asset. Peer orgs, their champions, their trust relationships. |
| Adaptation library | Curated collection of how orgs adapted the framework. Anonymized, battle-tested. The network's collective intelligence made tangible. |

---

## Key Activities

| Activity | Cadence |
|----------|---------|
| Frontier research — track Agentics Foundation, protocols, tooling, academic work | Continuous |
| Deliver cohort programs | Ongoing |
| Adapt framework to new orgs (plug point integration) | Per engagement |
| Grow champions | Ongoing |
| Synthesize — merge frontier research with network experience into curated practices | Quarterly |
| Curate adaptation library | Ongoing (community-sourced) |
| Facilitate community of practice | Ongoing |

**The critical activity is the synthesis.** Frontier research alone is academic. Network experience alone is anecdotal. The synthesis — "here's what's emerging AND here's what's proven" — is what makes our curated practices the best available. This is the thing we must be excellent at.

**The second critical activity is growing the network.** More orgs = richer adaptation data = better curated practices = more attractive network. The flywheel.

---

## Key Partnerships

| Partner type | Role |
|-------------|------|
| No-code platforms | Hands-on lab environment. n8n, Zapier, Make. Org chooses. |
| Independent facilitators / boutique firms | Deliver with their own style. Not franchisees — peers. |
| Design partner orgs | Co-develop the framework through real use. First 3-5 orgs. |
| AI vendors | Case studies, guest expertise. Not exclusivity. |
| Community contributors | Champions who share adaptations back. The lifeblood. |

**No franchise model. No licensed delivery scripts.** Partners and champions adapt the framework to their context. We maintain the core. The relationship is peer, not parent-child.

---

## Cost Structure

| Cost | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Framework development | Fixed, upfront | Heaviest early investment. Must be excellent and adaptable. |
| Facilitator network | Variable, per-cohort | Experienced people, not cheap. Quality matters. |
| Adaptation work | Variable, per-org | Integrating plug points with org-specific context |
| Platform/tooling | Fixed, low | n8n is open source; others have free tiers |
| Framework maintenance | Fixed, quarterly | Keep core current with agent landscape |
| Community operations | Fixed, ongoing | Platform, events, curation |

**Cost structure has network economics.** Early: heavy investment in framework + first orgs (consulting-adjacent). As the network grows: adaptation cost per org drops because the library has more patterns to draw from. Champions deliver internally at zero cost to us. The network becomes self-reinforcing — more orgs contributing means less work per new org joining.

---

## The Flywheel

The network of companies is the flywheel. The training is the forum where it compounds.

```
Org joins the network (via training)
       ↓
Adapts framework to their reality (plug points)
       ↓
Deploys real agents with real policies
       ↓
Shares what worked (and what didn't) back to the network
       ↓
Other orgs learn from their adaptation — faster, cheaper, less risk
       ↓
Network becomes more valuable → attracts next org
```

**Every org that joins makes the network more valuable for every other org.** A logistics company shares how they handled agent access to warehouse systems. A bank shares their compliance plug points. A healthcare org shares their patient data boundaries. None of them compete with each other — they all face the same novel problem (agent adoption) and learn faster together than alone.

**The training is the forum** — the structured occasion where organizations enter the network, build shared language, and start contributing. Without the training, the network has no entry point. Without the network, the training is just another course.

**The moat is the network, the research, and the synthesis.** Anyone can teach agent patterns. No vendor tracks the full frontier (only their own). No consultant has 50 orgs' deployment data. No MOOC updates quarterly. We sit at the intersection: frontier research (Agentics Foundation, Claude Flow, emerging protocols) synthesized with real deployment experience from the network. "Here's a new pattern from the Agentics Foundation — and here's how 5 network companies tested it, what worked, and what didn't." No one else can produce that.

---

## Agentic Rework Frameworks — Step 5

Previously flagged as a separate product line. Now integrated as Step 5 of the customer journey: once the org has agent competence (Bootstrap → Make Your Own → Champions → Scale), the question becomes "where do agents create real value in our business?" Value stream mapping → agentic business process re-engineering. The peer network and curated practices fuel this step — "here's how 12 companies drove agents into their logistics/compliance/customer service value chains."
