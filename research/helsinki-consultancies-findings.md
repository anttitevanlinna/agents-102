# Helsinki Consultancies — Findings & Orientation Log

**Track**: Helsinki/Finnish Mid-to-High-End Consultancies and AI/Agent Offerings

---

## Round 1 — 2026-02-14

### Observe

Searched: "Futurice Reaktor Helsinki consultancy AI agents offerings 2025 2026" and "Futurice Vincit Siili Columbia Road Finnish digital consultancy AI services training 2025 2026." Cataloged 8 firms across the Helsinki/Finnish digital consultancy ecosystem: Reaktor, Futurice, Columbia Road, Siili Solutions, Vincit, Gofore, Eficode, and VML Finland.

Key data points found:
- Reaktor has the most visible AI positioning: a dedicated Data & AI practice, VP-level AI leadership, and a joint GenAI research project with University of Helsinki involving multiple Finnish corporates. They also co-created Elements of AI (1M+ global enrollments) — but that is an intro awareness course from 2018, not a capability-building program.
- Siili Solutions brands itself as "AI-driven digital development" and has AI embedded across its delivery model.
- Eficode runs a commercial training business (DevOps, Atlassian, Kubernetes) — the only firm in this set with established training product mechanics.
- No firm in this set has any publicly visible agentic AI offering, training program, or network/curation model.

### Orient

**The core finding: Helsinki consultancies are not in the AI training or agentic AI space. They are in the bespoke consulting space.**

This entire cohort of firms operates on the same fundamental model: sell talented people doing custom work for enterprise clients. Whether it is Reaktor (strategy + engineering), Futurice (design + transformation), Siili (AI-driven development), or Gofore (public sector digital), the revenue comes from project-based or capacity-based consulting engagements. None of them sells scalable programs, curated practice libraries, or network-based knowledge products.

**Are any of these firms building network/curation models?**

No. Zero. The closest thing to a network play is Reaktor's Elements of AI, which built massive reach (1M+ enrollments) but was a brand-building / public good initiative, not a commercial network product. It created awareness, not a revenue-generating community of practice. No firm has anything resembling the "network of companies is the product" model that Agents 102 is building.

**Could any of them pivot to our model quickly?**

Unlikely, for structural reasons:

1. **Consulting economics work against training economics.** These firms charge EUR 150-250/hour per consultant. A senior consultant generating EUR 300K+ in annual billing is not going to be redeployed to facilitate EUR 5K training cohorts. The opportunity cost is wrong. To pivot to training, they would need to accept lower per-person revenue in exchange for scale — which their boards and partners will resist because consulting margins are known and training margins are unproven.

2. **They lack the curatorial muscle.** Agents 102's model requires continuous frontier research synthesis plus network intelligence curation. These firms have deep project delivery skills but not a research/curation function. Reaktor's university research collaboration is the exception, but it is academic research (studying GenAI productivity), not practice curation (distilling how companies deploy agents). Different skill.

3. **They lack the training infrastructure.** Only Eficode has training product mechanics (catalog, facilitators, enterprise sales, scheduling). The rest would need to build training operations from scratch. This is not hard in principle, but it requires a different organizational capability than consulting delivery — and consultancies tend to underinvest in it because it feels like a distraction from billable work.

4. **Culture and identity mismatch.** These firms identify as "we solve your unique problem" — not as "we teach you to solve it yourself and connect you with peers." The consulting identity is deeply embedded. Pivoting to a training/network model would require a philosophical shift that most consulting partners would resist. "Why would we teach our clients to do what we charge them for?"

**What is the real competitive threat here?**

The threat is not direct competition. None of these firms will build an Agents 102-like offering in the next 12-18 months. The threat is more subtle and has three forms:

1. **Credibility capture.** Reaktor, Futurice, and Siili have deep enterprise relationships in Finland and the Nordics. When a Finnish SVP of HR asks "who should we talk to about AI agents?", these firms are on the shortlist — not because they have agent training, but because they have trust. If they start offering even basic AI workshops to their existing clients (which is likely), they may absorb the local demand before Agents 102 reaches those buyers. The threat is not a competing product — it is a competing relationship.

2. **Embedded AI upskilling within consulting engagements.** When Reaktor or Futurice delivers an AI project, they often embed knowledge transfer. The client's team learns by working alongside the consultants. This is not a training product, but it competes for the same budget and attention. An SVP might say "we'll have Reaktor build it and teach our team as they go" rather than "let's send our team to an external training program."

3. **Elements of AI redux.** Reaktor demonstrated with Elements of AI that they can create massive-reach educational products when motivated. If Reaktor decided to create "Elements of Agentic AI" with the University of Helsinki, it would have instant credibility, university backing, and Reaktor's brand. This is the highest-risk scenario — but it is unlikely in the near term because (a) Reaktor has no commercial incentive to build a free course again, and (b) their current GenAI research project is academic, not educational.

**Structural limitation shared by all these firms:**

They are consulting businesses. Their entire economic engine — incentives, talent model, client relationships, pricing, partner compensation — is built around selling bespoke expert time. Building a scalable training/network product is a fundamentally different business. It requires different unit economics, different talent (facilitators and curators, not senior consultants), different sales motions (program sales, not project sales), and different success metrics (network growth, not utilization rate). Consultancies talk about "productizing" their knowledge, but almost none actually do it at scale, because the consulting model is too profitable and too familiar to abandon.

This is why McKinsey, Deloitte, and BCG — firms with vastly more resources — have also not built AI training products (see competitors-direct-findings.md, Round 3). If the global consulting giants have not done it, Helsinki consultancies are even less likely to.

**How close are they to the Agents 102 model?**

Not close. The distance is not just about AI/agents — it is about the fundamental business model:

| Agents 102 model element | Helsinki consultancies |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Network of companies is the product | No network model. Client relationships are bilateral (firm-to-client). |
| Training is the entry forum | No training products (except Eficode in DevOps). |
| Curated best-in-class practices | No curation function. Knowledge stays inside projects. |
| Vendor-agnostic, principle-first | They are vendor-agnostic in delivery, but do not teach principles — they apply them for the client. |
| Non-coder audience | Their client contacts are often executives and managers, but they serve them with consulting, not with training. |
| Agentic AI focus | No visible agentic AI positioning at any firm. |

### Decide

**Do we need another round?**

Maybe, but not urgently. The Finnish consultancy landscape is well-mapped for competitive purposes. The finding is clear: these firms are not in our space and are unlikely to enter it soon.

**What a Round 2 could investigate:**

1. **Nordic (non-Finnish) consultancies** — are firms like Netlight (Sweden), Computas (Norway), or Knowit (pan-Nordic) doing anything different in AI training or agentic AI? The competitive frame might be Nordic, not just Finnish.

2. **Finnish AI-native firms** — not traditional consultancies but AI-first companies like Silo AI (acquired by AMD), Houston Analytics, or smaller AI shops. These are not "enterprise-trusted consultancies" in the traditional sense but may be building AI training or advisory products.

3. **Finnish corporate training market** — who actually sells training to Finnish enterprises today? Not AI-specific, but the training market infrastructure. If Agents 102 enters Finland, who are the established training providers that enterprise L&D buyers already trust? Think Aalto EE, Hanken, Nordic Business Forum, corporate training houses. This would map the go-to-market landscape rather than the AI competitor landscape.

**Recommendation:** Pause this track. The competitive threat from Helsinki consultancies is low and structural, not urgent. If we do another round, option 3 (Finnish corporate training buyers and infrastructure) is the most actionable — it maps the sales channel, not the competitor set. But this is lower priority than content development and pilot design.

## Round 2 — 2026-02-15 — Finnish Corporate Training Buyers + Flagged Firms

### Observe

Searched: "Aalto EE executive education AI training Hanken SSE executive education Nordic Business Forum Finland corporate training 2025 2026" and "Solita Finland AI consultancy agentic AI Renessai AI company Finland offerings training 2025 2026." Cataloged 5 additional entities in two categories: (A) Finnish corporate training buyers — Aalto EE, Hanken & SSE Executive Education, Nordic Business Forum; (B) Flagged firms — Solita, Renessai.

Key data points found:

- **Aalto EE** has launched at least 6 AI-related executive programs (2024-2026), including "AI for Leaders and Decision-Makers" and "Data, Analytics, and AI for Professionals." They serve ~7,000 participants/year from ~1,000 organizations. This is the dominant Finnish executive education provider and owns the L&D buyer relationship in Finland. Their 2026 trends article highlights "strategic learning partnerships" and "uniquely human skills in the age of AI." They hosted CDOIQ Symposium in Helsinki (Feb 2026), positioning themselves as conveners of data/AI leadership.
- **Solita** is the most AI-advanced Finnish firm in our landscape. ~2,000 people, PE-backed (Apax Partners), with AI as a core identity. They have a proprietary AI platform (FunctionAI), offer generative AI services, and — critically — have publicly visible agentic AI content: an event titled "Deep Dive into Autonomous AI Agents" and language about AI agents performing tasks in agent networks. They offer "AI master classes and leadership coaching" but these appear to be consulting-embedded, not standalone training products.
- **Renessai** is a 14-person strategic AI consultancy founded by "AI pioneers." Strategy-first positioning ("we don't sell technologies or software"). Too small and too strategy-focused to be a competitive threat. Natural referral partner — they advise on AI strategy, which creates demand for the capability-building that Agents 102 provides.
- **Hanken & SSE** is a smaller, more traditional executive education provider. Limited AI focus. Not a significant factor.
- **Nordic Business Forum** is an events company, not a training provider. 7,000+ attendees at premium business conferences. Valuable as a lead generation channel (the attendees are our buyer's peer group) but will not compete on training.

### Orient

**The Finnish enterprise L&D buyer landscape has a clear hierarchy.**

The go-to-market question for Agents 102 in Finland is: "When a Finnish SVP of HR decides to invest in AI capability-building, who do they call?" The answer, from Round 2:

1. **Aalto EE is the default.** They are the dominant Finnish executive education provider, with the deepest enterprise L&D relationships. They already offer multiple AI programs. When a Finnish HR leader needs an AI training partner, Aalto EE is the first call — not because their AI programs are the best, but because the relationship and brand are established. Aalto EE is to Finnish corporate training what McKinsey is to Finnish strategy consulting: the safe choice.

2. **Consultancies are the second call.** When the ask is "help us deploy AI" (not "train our people on AI"), the buyer calls Solita, Reaktor, or Futurice. These firms absorb demand through consulting-embedded training — building alongside the client, with knowledge transfer as a side effect. Solita is the strongest player here, with the deepest AI expertise and the only visible agentic AI positioning.

3. **Everything else is niche.** Hanken & SSE for Swedish-speaking/Nordic finance circles. NBF for event-based inspiration. Renessai for boutique strategic AI advice. None of these are primary competitors or channels.

**Does this change the competitive picture from Round 1?**

Yes, meaningfully, in two ways:

**First: Aalto EE is a significant landscape factor that Round 1 missed.** Unlike the consultancies mapped in Round 1 (which sell expert time, not training), Aalto EE is a training institution. Training is their core business. They already have AI programs. They already have the buyer. The risk is not that Aalto EE builds an Agents 102-like product (they probably will not — their DNA is academic/managerial education, not practitioner capability-building or network curation). The risk is that the Finnish buyer says "we already have Aalto EE for AI training" and does not see the need for Agents 102. Aalto EE could pre-empt demand by offering something "good enough" — even if it is strategically framed AI literacy rather than hands-on agentic capability.

The opportunity, however, is also large. Aalto EE is a potential channel partner. If Agents 102 co-branded with or delivered through Aalto EE, it would inherit their buyer relationships, their credibility, and their sales infrastructure. Aalto EE benefits because they get cutting-edge agentic content they cannot develop in-house (they lack the practitioner/curatorial capability). Agents 102 benefits because they get instant access to Finnish enterprise L&D buyers. This is the single highest-leverage partnership opportunity in the Finnish market.

**Second: Solita is a more serious embedded threat than any Round 1 firm.** Solita has genuine AI/agent expertise, 2,000+ people, deep enterprise relationships, and is already running AI agent events. When a Finnish enterprise wants to "do AI agents," Solita is the most credible answer — and they will offer consulting-embedded training (master classes, coaching) as part of the engagement. This does not directly compete with Agents 102's model (network + curation + hands-on training for non-coders), but it competes for the same budget and attention. The SVP of HR might say "Solita is already training our people as part of their AI project" and decide that is sufficient. Solita will not build a network/curation model (they are a consulting firm, with consulting economics), but they can absorb incremental training demand inside their existing engagements.

**Could any of these be channel partners?**

| Entity | Channel potential | How |
|--------|------------------|-----|
| Aalto EE | HIGH | Co-branded programs. Aalto EE provides buyer access and credibility. Agents 102 provides agentic content and network model. Aalto EE lacks the practitioner depth; Agents 102 lacks the Finnish institutional brand. Complementary. |
| Solita | LOW-MEDIUM | Referral relationship. Solita deploys AI solutions; Agents 102 builds the workforce capability to sustain them. Solita benefits because capable client teams make consulting engagements more successful. But Solita may view Agents 102 as reducing their consulting dependency. |
| Nordic Business Forum | MEDIUM | Lead generation. Speak at or sponsor NBF events to reach the Finnish executive buyer audience. Not a delivery channel. |
| Renessai | LOW-MEDIUM | Referral. Renessai advises on AI strategy; Agents 102 executes the capability-building. Natural sequence. Small firm, so limited volume. |
| Hanken & SSE | LOW | Minor co-delivery opportunity for Nordic/Swedish-speaking segment. |

**Updated threat assessment — the Finnish landscape:**

The competitive terrain is now clearer. The threat is NOT that someone builds an Agents 102 clone. The threat has three layers:

1. **Aalto EE absorbs demand with "good enough" AI training.** Their programs are strategic/managerial, not hands-on agentic — but the Finnish buyer may not distinguish. If Aalto EE launches an "AI Agents for Leaders" program (plausible within 12 months), it could pre-empt demand even though it would be lecture-based strategy education, not practitioner capability-building with peer network curation.

2. **Solita absorbs demand through embedded consulting.** Solita delivers AI agent projects and embeds training as a side effect. This is the "we already have an AI partner" objection. Solita's AI master classes could be positioned against Agents 102 even though they are different in model and depth.

3. **Credibility capture by incumbents.** Same as Round 1: when a Finnish buyer asks "who should we talk to about AI agents?", the answer is Solita, Reaktor, or Aalto EE — because they have existing trust. Agents 102 needs to either partner with one of these (fastest path) or build independent credibility (slower but more independent path).

**What Round 2 confirms that Round 1 suggested:**

No entity in the Finnish landscape is building the Agents 102 model — a network of companies as the product, with training as the entry forum and curated best-in-class agentic practices as the sustained value. Aalto EE is a training institution but does not have a network-is-the-product model. Solita has AI agent expertise but is a consulting firm. Renessai is strategic but tiny. The model remains a blue ocean in Finland. The question is go-to-market: partner with Aalto EE for instant access to buyers, or build independently for full control.

### Decide

**Is another round needed?**

Not urgently for the Finnish landscape. The buyer map is now clear: Aalto EE owns the relationship, Solita is the embedded threat, everything else is secondary.

**What is still unclear:**

1. **Aalto EE's AI program content depth** — are their programs truly strategic/managerial, or do some of them include hands-on AI building? If they have hands-on elements, the competitive overlap is closer than assessed. A direct review of their program syllabi would clarify this.
2. **Solita's AI master class format** — are these one-off workshops or structured programs? How close to a training product vs. consulting delivery? Detail on this would sharpen the embedded-threat assessment.
3. **The Nordic (non-Finnish) layer** — Swedish, Norwegian, Danish executive education providers and AI training landscape. If Agents 102 targets the Nordics (not just Finland), this layer needs mapping. But this is a separate research track, not a continuation of the Finnish landscape.

**Recommendation:** The Finnish competitive landscape is now well-mapped across two rounds (13 entities: 8 consultancies, 2 executive education providers, 1 events company, 1 large AI consultancy, 1 boutique AI consultancy). The strategic priority is not more research — it is to decide on the Aalto EE partnership question. That is a business development decision, not a research question.
