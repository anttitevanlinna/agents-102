## Organizations Found

### 1. Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF) — Linux Foundation

- **URL**: https://openai.com/index/agentic-ai-foundation/
- **What it is**: Open-source foundation under the Linux Foundation, launched December 2025. Founding members include Anthropic, OpenAI, and Block.
- **What it does**: Consolidates open interoperability standards for agentic AI — specifically MCP (Model Context Protocol from Anthropic), Goose (Block's agent framework), and AGENTS.md (OpenAI's convention, adopted by 60,000+ repos). Focuses on protocol standardization and governance.
- **Who it serves**: Developers building agent infrastructure. Enterprises wanting interoperability guarantees.
- **Business model**: Linux Foundation model — member dues from companies, open-source governance, likely certification revenue in time.
- **Scale**: Major founding members (Big Tech). Early stage as an institution.
- **Proximity to our model**: **LOW**. AAIF is a standards body. It curates *protocols*, not *deployment practices*. It does not run peer networks of companies sharing how they deploy agents. It does not synthesize member experience into practice packs. It is the plumbing layer, not the practice layer.
- **What it is missing relative to our vision**: Everything above the protocol layer — no practitioner network, no curated deployment practices, no training-as-entry-point, no collaborative learning, no practice packs.

### 2. LangChain / State of Agent Engineering

- **URL**: https://www.langchain.com/state-of-agent-engineering
- **What it is**: LangChain publishes annual "State of Agent Engineering" reports synthesizing survey data from agent builders.
- **What it does**: Surveys practitioners, aggregates findings, publishes trends (57% have agents in production, integration challenges, etc.). Also runs LangSmith (observability) and LangGraph (framework).
- **Who it serves**: Developers and technical leaders building agents.
- **Business model**: Venture-backed (Series A, ~$25M). Product revenue from LangSmith/LangGraph. The reports are marketing/thought leadership.
- **Scale**: Large developer community. Hundreds of thousands of developers use their tools.
- **Proximity to our model**: **LOW-MEDIUM**. LangChain aggregates practitioner data and publishes synthesis — that is a weak form of practice curation. But it is a developer tool company that uses surveys for marketing, not a peer network that generates collective intelligence. There is no membership, no collaborative, no structured practice sharing between member companies.
- **What it is missing relative to our vision**: No peer network. No company-to-company practice sharing. No structured collaboratives. No training entry point. The "curation" is one-way (survey → report), not collaborative (members contribute → members receive refined practices).

### 3. Partnership on AI (PAI)

- **URL**: https://partnershiponai.org/
- **What it is**: Multi-stakeholder nonprofit founded 2016 by Amazon, Apple, DeepMind, Facebook, Google, IBM, Microsoft. 100+ member organizations.
- **What it does**: Develops guidelines, frameworks, and research on responsible AI. Focuses on ethics, fairness, safety, societal impact.
- **Who it serves**: AI companies, civil society, academics, policymakers.
- **Business model**: Member dues + grants. Nonprofit.
- **Scale**: 100+ member organizations.
- **Proximity to our model**: **LOW**. PAI curates *ethical guidelines*, not *deployment practices*. It is a policy/ethics body, not a practitioner network. Members do not share how they deploy agents operationally — they discuss responsible use principles.
- **What it is missing relative to our vision**: Not focused on operational deployment. No training entry point. No practice packs. No structured collaborative model. The "practices" are ethical frameworks, not deployment playbooks.

### 4. AI Alliance (Meta/IBM-led)

- **What it is**: Open-innovation consortium launched late 2023, led by Meta and IBM. 100+ members including universities, companies, nonprofits.
- **What it does**: Promotes open-source AI, develops benchmarks, safety tools, and educational resources. Working groups on trust/safety, policy, applications.
- **Who it serves**: Researchers, developers, policymakers.
- **Business model**: No membership fees (as of last report). Supported by founding members.
- **Scale**: 100+ members globally.
- **Proximity to our model**: **LOW**. Focused on open-source AI advocacy and safety standards. Not a practitioner network for deployment practices. No structured practice sharing between member companies about how they deploy agents.
- **What it is missing relative to our vision**: Everything operational — no deployment practice curation, no peer network for practitioners, no training entry point, no practice packs.

### 5. Enterprise AI Communities of Practice (Internal)

- **What**: KPMG, Accenture, McKinsey, Deloitte, and major consultancies all have internal AI/Agentic AI practices and run client communities.
- **Evidence**: KPMG's "AI at Scale" report (https://kpmg.com/us/en/media/news/q4-ai-pulse.html) demonstrates thought leadership positioning but not a peer network model.
- **Proximity to our model**: **LOW-MEDIUM**. Consultancies synthesize deployment patterns from client engagements — that is practice curation. Some run client roundtables and communities. But they are consulting firms, not peer networks. The value extraction flows to the consultancy, not back to the network. Clients are customers, not co-creators.
- **What it is missing relative to our vision**: No true peer network (clients don't share with each other, they share with the consultant). No training-as-entry-point model. No practice packs as a distinct product. No flywheel — the consultancy captures the intelligence and resells it as advisory.

### 6. Gartner / Forrester Peer Communities

- **What**: Gartner Peer Community, Forrester's community features — forums where enterprise technology leaders discuss AI deployment.
- **Proximity to our model**: **LOW-MEDIUM**. These are forums, not structured collaboratives. Members post questions and share experiences informally. The analyst firm synthesizes this into reports and Magic Quadrants. But there is no structured collaborative (no change packages, no PDSA cycles, no practice packs). It is Gartner's analyst model with a community wrapper.
- **What it is missing**: Structured collaboration, practice curation from member experience (vs. analyst opinion), training as entry point, the IHI-style collaborative mechanics.

## What We Did NOT Find

Despite targeted searching, we did not find:

1. **Any "IHI for AI agents"** — No organization running structured collaboratives where companies test and share AI agent deployment practices in a systematic way (PDSA cycles, change packages, Learning Sessions).

2. **Any "Vistage for AI leaders"** — No peer advisory network specifically for executives navigating AI agent deployment. (Note: general AI executive networks may exist at small scale but did not surface in search.)

3. **Any venture-backed startup building "AI deployment practice networks"** — No startup positioning itself as a curator of collective intelligence about agent deployment.

4. **Any open-source community curating enterprise deployment patterns** — AAIF curates protocols. Nobody curates deployment patterns (how to organize teams, how to manage change, how to measure ROI, how to handle failure modes).

5. **Any membership organization where companies pay to share and receive curated AI agent deployment practices** — This specific product does not appear to exist.
