## The Problem

**Headline:** The gap is not between strategy and execution.

Everyone has an AI strategy now. The board has seen the McKinsey report. A governance framework has been approved. An initiative portfolio is underway.

Eighteen months from now, nobody in leadership will have seen an agent work with your company's data. The frameworks will govern an abstraction. The initiatives will produce slides. And the transformation will feel like theatre -- because it is.

Previous transformations could be led from strategy alone. An executive did not need to build software to envision a digital company. The agentic shift is different. You cannot lead what you cannot picture. And you cannot picture it without building it.

The gap is between strategy and competence.

## What We Do

**Headline:** Train. Curate. Connect.

### Train

Your people build working agents on day one. With your security policies, your systems, your processes. Not a vendor demo. Not a generic MOOC. Your reality.

The output is not a certificate. It is twenty people who can think agents -- and show the rest of the organization what is possible.

### Curate

We track the frontier so you do not have to. Eighty percent from the best public research -- emerging patterns, protocols, open-source tooling, real deployments. Twenty percent from peer companies in the network who share what actually worked and what did not.

No vendor tracks the full landscape. No consultant has deployment data from thirty organizations. We synthesize both.

### Connect

The peer network is the long-term product. Companies navigating the same transformation, learning from each other. A bank learns from a logistics company that already deployed agents in a regulated environment. That trust signal is worth more than any consultancy recommendation.

Not structured data collection. Peer forums designed for how leaders actually share -- honest, off the record, practitioner to practitioner.

## The Journey

**Headline:** Five steps from first agent to organizational capability.

**1. Bootstrap**
Two-day intensive. EUR 500 per person. You build a real agent. The skeptics in the room become believers. This is the door -- anyone can walk in.

**2. Make Your Own**
A cohort of your change leaders designs the rollout. Four to six weeks. Not just "we learned agents" but "we have a plan to transform." Change strategy lab with mentoring.

**3. Champions**
The strongest people from Bootstrap learn to facilitate, adapt, and carry it forward. Train-the-trainer. The multiplier.

**4. Scale**
Champions run it inside your organization. With your structure, your pace, your priorities. Zero external dependency. Zero cost to us.

**5. Drive into Value Chains**
The organization has agent competence. Now the real question: where do agents create actual business value? Map your value chains. Rework them. Learn from peers who have already driven agents into similar processes.

All materials are co-branded with your organization and co-copyright for further development. You do not license our IP. You co-own it. If you stop working with us, you keep everything.

## For Leaders

**Headline:** Questions worth asking before your next board meeting.

What if your people could build agents next week — not next quarter?

The tools exist. The use cases are obvious. What are you waiting for?

Your competitor isn't planning AI. They're building it. Today.

The gap isn't strategy. It's that nobody in the building has built one yet.

Two days. Twenty people. Real agents. What would that change?

## About

**Headline:** Practitioner, not academic.

Agents 102 is built by Bosser. Twenty-five years leading strategic transformations at Finland's most demanding organizations -- F-Secure, Neste, Posti Group. Over two hundred people trained and coached. A working version of this training is already being delivered.

We are framework-integrative, not framework-driven. Deep familiarity with every major strategic and change framework -- but frameworks serve the situation, not the other way around. Intelligence applied with practitioner judgment.

We do not sell certainty. Nobody knows exactly where agentic AI is going. But we know that agents are being built right now, by real people, solving real problems. The organizations that start moving -- experimenting, learning, adapting -- will shape what comes next. The ones waiting for a complete roadmap will be reading about it.

The best strategies emerge from action, not analysis.

## Contact

**Headline:** Let's talk.
