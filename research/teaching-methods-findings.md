## Key Patterns in LLM Agent Teaching

### 1. **Progressive Learning Path**
Most resources follow a progression:
- Fundamentals and concepts
- Building a simple agent
- Using frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAI, etc.)
- Tool integration and APIs
- Multi-agent systems
- Production considerations and evaluation

### 2. **Multiple Framework Emphasis**
No single framework dominates teaching. Instead, multiple frameworks are taught:
- **LangGraph**: Graph-based agent orchestration
- **CrewAI**: Role-based multi-agent systems
- **Phidata**: Multi-modal agents with memory
- **Mastra**: Modern TypeScript framework
- **OpenAI Agents SDK**: OpenAI native solution
- **LangChain**: General LLM application framework

This suggests teaching should cover framework concepts rather than a single tool.

### 3. **Hands-On Projects**
Nearly all resources emphasize building real projects:
- RAG applications
- Web automation agents
- Q&A chatbots
- Code generation agents
- YouTube summarizer agents
- Customer service agents

### 4. **Tool and API Integration**
Heavy focus on how agents interact with external tools and APIs. This is taught through:
- Function calling
- Tool definitions
- API integration patterns
- Error handling in tool use

### 5. **Prompt Engineering as Critical Skill**
Recognized across all resources as fundamental to agent effectiveness:
- System prompts
- Instruction engineering
- Few-shot examples
- Chain-of-thought prompting
- Error recovery instructions

### 6. **Evaluation and Testing**
Growing emphasis in 2025-2026 on:
- Agent performance metrics
- Evaluation frameworks
- Testing strategies
- Production monitoring
- Quality assurance for agentic systems

### 7. **Multi-Agent Patterns**
Increasingly popular teaching topic:
- Agent coordination
- Task delegation
- Information sharing between agents
- Workflow orchestration

### 8. **RAG Integration**
RAG-agent systems positioned as key pattern for:
- Knowledge-intensive applications
- Question-answering systems
- Document analysis
- Information retrieval combined with reasoning

### 9. **Visual and Interactive Approaches**
Trend toward:
- Diagrams and visual explanations
- Interactive code playgrounds
- Video tutorials
- Code-along lessons
- Live demonstrations

### 10. **Accessibility Focus**
Many resources (Salesforce, Microsoft Learn, HuggingFace) target:
- Non-technical audiences
- Business leaders
- Career changers
- Self-paced learners
