Participants work through five dimensions of the "Agentic Enterprise" and apply them directly to their own organization. Explicitly targets organizational change, not individual tooling.
- **Target audience**: Transformation leaders, capability enablers, senior managers
- **Key topics**: Five dimensions of the Agentic Enterprise, organizational design for AI, strategic deployment
- **Format**: Live online, 4 sessions x 4 hours each
- **Duration**: ~16 hours across multiple sessions
- **Price**: Not confirmed (estimated EUR 1,500-2,500 based on DASA pricing patterns)
- **Enrollment/scale**: Not available

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Agentic Depth | 4 | Specifically about agentic AI, but strategic rather than build-focused |
| Audience Level | 5 | Designed for leaders and non-coders |
| Transformation Scope | 5 | Explicitly organizational transformation |
| Hands-On Intensity | 2 | Participants apply frameworks to their org, but unlikely to build working agents |

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Agentic Depth | 3 | Builds agents within Salesforce's definition of "agent" |
| Audience Level | 4 | Trailhead is famously accessible to non-developers |
| Transformation Scope | 1 | Ecosystem training, no organizational transformation framing |
| Hands-On Intensity | 4 | Trailhead's hands-on playground exercises |
| Fundamentals vs. Tools | 1 | 100% Salesforce Agentforce |

**Strengths vs. Agents 102**: Trailhead is one of the best-designed corporate learning platforms. Gamified, badge-driven, genuinely fun. Free and massive in reach. Salesforce's CRM dominance means many organizations will encounter Agentforce first. Community support (Agentblazers) creates peer learning.

**Gaps vs. Agents 102**: Entirely Salesforce-locked. "Agents" here means Agentforce agents — a specific product, not the general concept. No transferable understanding. No organizational transformation lens. Participants learn Salesforce's agent product, not agent thinking. Will not help someone evaluate whether Agentforce is even the right choice.

**Competitor criteria met**: Agentic (narrow — product-specific), Transformative (no), Company-scale (no), Hands-on (yes, platform-specific).

## 11. McKinsey — "Unlocking AI and Agentic for Your Organization"

- **URL**: https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/how-we-help-clients/agentic-organization
- **Provider**: McKinsey & Company (People & Organizational Performance practice)
- **Type**: Consulting engagement / advisory service (not a training program)
- **Description**: McKinsey's offering around the "Agentic Organization" is a consulting engagement, not a standalone training program. It sits within their People & Organizational Performance practice and focuses on helping leadership teams redesign their organizations around agentic AI capabilities — workforce redesign, operating model changes, and capability building. McKinsey publishes thought leadership (including the "Agentic Organization" framework) but monetizes through bespoke consulting, not enrollable courses.
- **Target audience**: C-suite and senior leadership at large enterprises
- **Key topics**: Organizational redesign for agentic AI, workforce transformation, capability building, operating model changes
- **Format**: Bespoke consulting engagements, executive briefings, workshops embedded in consulting projects
- **Duration**: Months-long consulting engagements (not a fixed training program)
- **Price**: Consulting rates (USD 500K-5M+ per engagement, not per-seat training pricing)
- **Enrollment/scale**: Small — tens of client organizations per year, not hundreds of individual learners

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Agentic Depth | 4 | Deep strategic understanding of agentic AI, but no hands-on building |
| Audience Level | 5 | Designed for C-suite and senior leaders |

Massive credibility with executive buyers. Published thought leadership creates awareness for the concept that Agents 102 also teaches.

**Gaps vs. Agents 102**: Not a training program at all — it is consulting. No one "enrolls." No hands-on building. Inaccessible to anyone outside Fortune 500 budgets. Creates strategy decks, not capability. Participants (clients) do not learn to build or evaluate agents themselves — McKinsey does it for them.

**Competitor criteria met**: Agentic (strategic only), Transformative (yes), Company-scale (yes), Hands-on (no).

Accenture has invested USD 3 billion in AI and is doubling its AI workforce to 80,000. BCG has formal partnerships with OpenAI and Anthropic. None of these firms offers a standalone, enrollable training program on agentic AI. Instead, they embed capability-building workshops within larger consulting engagements. Training is a deliverable within a project, not a product.
- **Target audience**: Enterprise clients (typically Fortune 500 / Global 2000)
- **Key topics**: AI strategy, agent deployment, vendor evaluation, workforce transformation, change management
- **Format**: Bespoke consulting + embedded workshops/training sessions
- **Duration**: Weeks to months within larger engagements
- **Price**: Consulting rates (USD 250K-10M+ per engagement)
- **Enrollment/scale**: Small — client-by-client basis

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Agentic Depth | 3 | Broad AI advisory that includes agentic — not agentic-specific programs |
| Audience Level | 5 | Designed for executive and leadership audiences |

- **Type**: Self-paced online courses
- **Description**: A growing ecosystem of Udemy courses teaching AI agent building using no-code platforms like n8n, Zapier, Make, Relevance AI, and Voiceflow. Courses range from 10 to 30+ hours and target beginners and non-technical users. The most popular ones focus on n8n as the primary agent-building platform. Several explicitly promise "no coding required" and frame agent building as a business skill or freelance service.
- **Target audience**: Beginners, non-technical users, freelancers wanting to sell agent-building services
- **Key topics**: No-code AI agent building, workflow automation, n8n/Zapier/Make platform usage, RAG, API integration, AI voice agents
- **Format**: Self-paced video courses with exercises
- **Duration**: 10-30+ hours per course
- **Price**: USD 15-80 (Udemy pricing with frequent sales)
- **Enrollment/scale**: Moderate to large — several courses with 5,000-50,000+ students

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Agentic Depth | 3 | Builds working agents, but scope is task automation rather than organizational transformation |
| Audience Level | 5 | Explicitly designed for non-coders and beginners |
| Transformation Scope | 1 | Individual skill building, zero organizational framing |
| Hands-On Intensity | 5 | Every course is build-along, participants create working agents |
| Fundamentals vs. Tools | 2 | Almost entirely tool-specific (n8n, Zapier, etc.) |

**Strengths vs. Agents 102**: Actually deliver on the "non-coders building agents" promise. Cheap and accessible. Participants leave with working automations. Practical and immediately useful. n8n in particular is open-source and relatively vendor-neutral.

**Gaps vs. Agents 102**: Zero organizational transformation framing. Teach tool operation, not agent thinking. No strategic context — participants learn to wire nodes in n8n, not to evaluate whether an agent is the right solution. No coverage of when agents fail, ethical considerations, or cross-platform architecture. Freelancer/side-hustle framing, not enterprise transformation. Quality varies wildly across instructors.

**Competitor criteria met**: Agentic (partial — automation-oriented), Transformative (no), Company-scale (no), Hands-on (yes).

---

## 14. Zapier Agents — Platform Documentation & Guides

- **URL**: https://zapier.com/agents (product); various blog posts and guides
- **Provider**: Zapier
- **Type**: Product documentation and guides (not a formal training program)
- **Description**: Zapier rebranded its "Central" product as "Zapier Agents" in early 2025 — a more autonomous AI system that works across 7,000+ apps. Zapier provides product documentation, blog posts, and tutorial guides, but does not offer a structured training program, learning path, or certification. Education is embedded in product onboarding and help docs, not in a standalone course. Third-party Udemy instructors have filled the gap with Zapier-focused courses.
- **Target audience**: Existing Zapier users, automation enthusiasts, non-technical users
- **Key topics**: Building agents across the Zapier ecosystem, multi-app workflows, AI-powered automation
- **Format**: Product docs, blog tutorials, onboarding flows
- **Duration**: N/A (no structured program)
- **Price**: Free docs (Zapier Agents requires paid Zapier subscription)
- **Enrollment/scale**: Large user base (Zapier has millions of users) but no formal training enrollment

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Agentic Depth | 3 | "Agents" are task-automation agents, not autonomous reasoning agents |
| Audience Level | 5 | Zapier's entire brand is accessibility for non-coders |
| Transformation Scope | 1 | Individual productivity tool, no organizational framing |
| Hands-On Intensity | 3 | Product use is inherently hands-on, but no structured learning path |
| Fundamentals vs. Tools | 1 | 100% Zapier-specific |

**Strengths vs. Agents 102**: Zapier's massive user base means many people's first encounter with "AI agents" will be through Zapier Agents. The product is genuinely accessible to non-coders. Integration with 7,000+ apps gives real-world utility immediately.

**Gaps vs. Agents 102**: No training program exists — just product docs. "Agents" means something narrower than what Agents 102 teaches. No transferable understanding. No organizational framing. Zapier Agents is a feature within a product, not a capability within a person.

**Competitor criteria met**: Agentic (narrow — product feature), Transformative (no), Company-scale (no), Hands-on (through product use, not training).

- **Description**: Both Make and n8n offer in-platform education resources. Make has a "Make Academy" with structured courses on automation. n8n provides documentation-based courses and an active community. Neither has a dedicated "AI agent training program" — AI agent building is taught as one capability within their broader automation education. Third-party Udemy instructors have built more structured agent-focused courses around these platforms (see entry 13).
- **Target audience**: Platform users, automation enthusiasts, citizen developers
- **Key topics**: Workflow automation, AI integrations, agent-like automation patterns
- **Format**: In-platform courses, documentation, community forums
- **Duration**: Self-paced (no fixed program)
- **Price**: Free (platform subscriptions separate)
- **Enrollment/scale**: Growing — n8n in particular has strong community momentum in the AI agent space

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Agentic Depth | 2 | AI agents are one feature among many automation capabilities |
| Audience Level | 4 | Designed for non-developers, though n8n skews slightly technical |
| Transformation Scope | 1 | Individual tool training |
| Hands-On Intensity | 4 | Platform-native exercises, learn by building |
| Fundamentals vs. Tools | 1 | 100% platform-specific |

**Strengths vs. Agents 102**: Practical, accessible, and tied to real automation platforms. n8n's open-source nature gives it credibility with technically curious non-coders. Make Academy is well-structured.

**Gaps vs. Agents 102**: AI agents are a side topic, not the focus. No agentic AI framing, strategy, or organizational transformation. Platform-locked learning. No coverage of agent design principles, failure modes, or evaluation frameworks.

**Competitor criteria met**: Agentic (minor feature), Transformative (no), Company-scale (no), Hands-on (yes, platform-specific).
