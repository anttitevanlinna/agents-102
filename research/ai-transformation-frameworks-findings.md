# AI Transformation Frameworks — Findings & Implications for Agents 102

OODA Round 1 | 2026-02-15

---

## Orientation: What did we learn?

### The landscape has shifted dramatically in 12 months

Until mid-2025, the dominant AI transformation frameworks (Andrew Ng's Playbook, Gartner Maturity Model, McKinsey State of AI) were essentially about **"AI adoption"** — how to go from zero to deploying ML/AI in an organization. They treated AI as a technology capability to be acquired and scaled.

Starting in late 2025, every major consulting firm and research institution has published something specifically about **agentic AI** — and the framing has changed fundamentally:

- **Deloitte** warns about "agent sprawl" and calls for strategic orchestration
- **IBM** says organizations must "manage agents as workers"
- **MIT Sloan / BCG** frames the core question as which decisions humans keep vs. delegate
- **McKinsey** distinguishes "Factory" (autonomous agents) from "Artisan" (AI-assisted humans) patterns
- **Google Cloud** published an HBR blueprint for enterprise-wide agentic transformation in February 2026

This means: **the "agentic enterprise" concept is now mainstream at the executive level.** Every CDO, CIO, and SVP of Strategy has seen at least one of these publications.

### Three generations of frameworks are now coexisting

| Generation | Timeframe | Core question | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gen 1: AI Readiness | 2017-2022 | "How do we start with AI?" | Andrew Ng's Playbook, Gartner Maturity Model |
| Gen 2: Gen AI Adoption | 2023-2024 | "How do we deploy gen AI at scale?" | McKinsey Gen AI Shifts, Microsoft Copilot Framework |
| Gen 3: Agentic Transformation | 2025-2026 | "How do we build an organization where agents work alongside humans?" | MIT Agentic Enterprise, IBM Agentic Operating Model, Deloitte Agentic AI Strategy |

Most organizations are still mentally in Gen 1 or Gen 2. The Gen 3 frameworks are being published but adoption of the thinking is early.

### What these frameworks do NOT cover

Despite the explosion of agentic frameworks, we identified consistent gaps:

1. **Hands-on capability building.** Every framework says "upskill your workforce" but none provide the actual training. They are strategy documents, not curricula.
2. **Non-coder audiences.** The frameworks assume the reader will hand off implementation to a technical team. They do not teach business people to build or configure agents themselves.
3. **Network/ecosystem effects.** The frameworks treat each organization as an island. None address how companies learn from each other or share agentic practices across a network.
4. **Practice-level detail.** They describe what a mature agentic organization looks like, but not the daily practices, rituals, and workflows that get you there.
5. **Cross-functional integration.** Most are written for IT/technology leadership. The HR, finance, and operations perspectives are underserved.

## Implications for Agents 102

### We are the prerequisite — not the complement — for these frameworks

The agentic transformation is fundamentally different from previous ones (digital, agile, cloud). In those, executives didn't need to personally build software to envision a digital company — the vision was accessible through strategy and analysis. Consultancies could hand it down in slide decks.

Agents are different. **You cannot envision what agents do for your organization if you cannot think agents.** Without hands-on competence, leadership governs an abstraction. The consultancy frameworks become theatre:

- Governance of something nobody in the room understands
- Lists of initiatives with no felt vision behind them
- Maturity models where nobody can picture what "Level 3" actually looks like
- Change programs that reproduce the consultancy's slides, not the organization's future

Agents 102 is not the execution layer under the strategy deck. **Agents 102 is the prerequisite for having a real strategy.** The vision — the real one — emerges from competence, not from analysis. Once people can think agents, the vision becomes obvious. It is not handed down. It emerges from building.

### Positioning

> "The consultancy frameworks are governance of an abstraction. We create the competence that makes the vision real."

Or in Bosser terms: the best strategies emerge from action, not analysis. We conjecture momentum.

### Frameworks we should reference and build on

| Framework | How to use it |
|---|---|
| **McKinsey Factory/Artisan** | Use this language when explaining agent deployment patterns — it resonates with executives |
| **Gartner Maturity Model** | Reference the 5 levels when helping organizations assess where they are |
| **MIT Agentic Enterprise** | Borrow the "which decisions do humans keep?" framing — it is the right strategic question |
| **IBM "agents as workers"** | Use this metaphor in training — it makes governance and management of agents intuitive |
| **Andrew Ng's Playbook** | Reference as the "previous generation" — show how agentic AI requires an updated approach |

### Frameworks we should be aware of but not anchor to

- **Deloitte, Google, Microsoft frameworks** — These are vendor-adjacent and will evolve with product strategies. Reference lightly, do not build curriculum around them.
- **WEF governance frameworks** — Important for compliance-oriented audiences but not our core focus.

### The "network of companies" angle is genuinely novel

None of the frameworks we found address **cross-company learning networks** for agentic practices. This is a real gap. The consulting firms sell advice one client at a time. We are building a mechanism for companies to learn from each other. This differentiation is worth emphasizing.

## Decide: Is another round needed?

**Probably not as a standalone track.** The landscape is clear enough to inform our positioning and curriculum design. However, two focused follow-ups could be useful:

1. **Deep-read of MIT Sloan "Emerging Agentic Enterprise" report** — This is the most intellectually rigorous framework and closest to our thinking. Worth a close read to ensure we align or deliberately diverge.
2. **Vendor-specific agentic frameworks (Salesforce Agentforce, Microsoft Copilot Studio, AWS Bedrock Agents)** — These are where our training participants will actually encounter agents. Could be a separate research track on "Agentic Platforms & Tools."

### What is still unclear

- How widely have these Gen 3 frameworks actually penetrated executive thinking in the Nordics specifically?
- Are there European/Nordic-specific frameworks we are missing (e.g., from Sitra, Business Finland, Nordic consulting firms)?
- What is the overlap between these frameworks and what our target Helsinki consultancies (see helsinki-consultancies research) are already using with their clients?
