# Agents 102

Training program for building AI agents. Three things: **Train → Curate → Connect.**

**Value prop:** Teach everyone to think. Scale for future. With your own structure.

**Buyer:** The builder leader — CEO/CTO/SVP HR who wants to own the transformation, not outsource it. Psychographic, not a title. Target: large Nordic companies in two segments: (1) software companies, (2) traditional companies striving for high digitalization.

**Core insight:** The agentic transformation is different from digital/agile/cloud. Without agent competence, there is no vision — just governance of an abstraction. We are the prerequisite, not the complement.

**Five-step customer journey:** Bootstrap (€500/person, 2 days) → Make Your Own (change strategy lab, 4-6 weeks, €25-40K/org) → Champions (train-the-trainer, €3-5K/person) → Scale (champions run internally, €0) → Drive into Value Chains (agentic rework + peer network).

**Model:** Framework + plug points. Co-branded, co-copyright — the org co-owns all materials for further development. 80/20 curation: 80% frontier research + 20% peer premium. We are curator + researcher, not the authority.

**Key files:**
- Business model canvas: `strategy/business-model-canvas.md`
- Assumption map: `strategy/assumption-map.md`
- Content strategy: `content-strategy.md`
- Training outline: `training-outline.md`
- Learning goals: `learning-goals.md`
- Nordic digital leaders: `research/nordic-digital-leaders-findings.md`
- All research: `research/` directory (see MEMORY.md for index)

**Bosser identity:** "The best strategies emerge from action, not analysis." Framework-integrative, not framework-driven. See Bosser site at `/Users/anttitevanlinna/Projects/bosser/docs/index.html`.

## Existing training

A working version of this training already exists and is being delivered at F-Secure. The existing curriculum has not yet been incorporated into this project's materials. It is a key input for future curriculum development.

## Project guidelines

- **COPYRIGHT: Do not reproduce, paraphrase, or closely adapt training content from any external source.** All curriculum content must be original. When researching competitors or benchmarks, extract insights about positioning and market gaps — never copy exercises, module structures, or instructional language.
- This is an educational project, not a software product
- Prioritize clarity and accessibility over technical depth
- Explain concepts in plain language first, then add technical detail where needed
- Use practical, real-world examples that resonate with business contexts
- Keep exercises hands-on and achievable without prior coding experience
- Framework-integrative, not framework-driven — frameworks serve the situation
- Research uses OODA loops — see `research/competitor-research-prompts.md` for methodology
- This is independent intellectual property — see COPYRIGHT.md for details
